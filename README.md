| **[Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04459v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on adaptive sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with $65536^3$ grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our voxel representation is seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing techniques such as Volume Fusion, Voxel Pooling, and Marching Cubes, enabling a wide range of future extensions and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://svraster.github.io/ Code at https://github.com/NVlabs/svraster</p></details> |
| **[RGB-Only Gaussian Splatting SLAM for Unbounded Outdoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15633v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a popular solution in SLAM, as it can produce high-fidelity novel views. However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

| **[SplatOverflow: Asynchronous Hardware Troubleshooting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02332v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As tools for designing and manufacturing hardware become more accessible, smaller producers can develop and distribute novel hardware. However, processes for supporting end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance aren't well defined. As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale software troubleshooting, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow. SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. A scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user's hardware registered onto the hardware's CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverflow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user's workspace. Workflows containing multiple instructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments. In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, the workflows it enables, and its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a usability study.

| **[DynamicGSG: Dynamic 3D Gaussian Scene Graphs for Environment Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15309v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, the environment changes caused by agents or human activities make it extremely challenging for robots to perform various long-term tasks. To effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments, the perception system of a robot needs to extract instance-level semantic information, reconstruct the environment in a fine-grained manner, and update its environment representation in memory according to environment changes. To address these challenges, We propose \textbf{DynamicGSG}, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph generation system leveraging Gaussian splatting. Our system comprises three key components: (1) constructing hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision foundation models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships of objects in the environment, (2) designing a joint feature loss to optimize the Gaussian map for incremental high-fidelity reconstruction, and (3) updating the Gaussian map and scene graph according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of the proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we have validated the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments. The source code will be released at:~\href{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/Dynamic-GSG}{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/DynamicGSG}.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDGS: Confidence-Aware Depth Regularization for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14684v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown significant advantages in novel view synthesis (NVS), particularly in achieving high rendering speeds and high-quality results. However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS-Cache: A GS-Cache Inference Framework for Large-scale Gaussian Splatting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14938v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that enhances optimization iterations, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica, TUM-RGBD, and VECtor datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing photorealistic scene representation.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our Hier-SLAM outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it exhibits competitive performance in rendering semantic segmentation in small synthetic scenes, with significantly reduced storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2025.

| **[OG-Gaussian: Occupancy Based Street Gaussians for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14235v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and realistic 3D scene reconstruction enables the lifelike creation of autonomous driving simulation environments. With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-Adapter: Geometry-Consistent Multi-View Diffusion for High-Quality 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18974v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view image diffusion models have significantly advanced open-domain 3D object generation. However, most existing models rely on 2D network architectures that lack inherent 3D biases, resulting in compromised geometric consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion. Furthermore, we showcase the broad application potential of 3D-Adapter by presenting high quality results in text-to-3D, image-to-3D, text-to-texture, and text-to-avatar tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lakonik.github.io/3d-adapter/</p></details> |

Most methods assume the people is in an unobstructed scene, while various objects may cause the occlusion of body parts in real-life scenarios. Previous method utilizing NeRF for surface rendering to recover the occluded areas, but it requiring more than one day to train and several seconds to render, failing to meet the requirements of real-time interactive applications. To address these issues, we propose OccGaussian based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which can be trained within 6 minutes and produces high-quality human renderings up to 160 FPS with occluded input. OccGaussian initializes 3D Gaussian distributions in the canonical space, and we perform occlusion feature query at occluded regions, the aggregated pixel-align feature is extracted to compensate for the missing information. Then we use Gaussian Feature MLP to further process the feature along with the occlusion-aware loss functions to better perceive the occluded area. Extensive experiments both in simulated and real-world occlusions, demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. And we improving training and inference speeds by 250x and 800x, respectively. Our code will be available for research purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have decided to withdraw this paper because the results require further verification or additional experimental data.

| **[GlossGau: Efficient Inverse Rendering for Glossy Surface with Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14129v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of 3D objects from calibrated photographs represents a fundamental yet intricate challenge in the domains of computer graphics and vision. Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain substantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely improves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic rendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical Harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in reconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular expressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves competitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces. Compared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our optimization time is considerably less.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting aided Localization for Large and Complex Indoor-Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13803v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of visual localization has been researched for several decades and has meanwhile found many practical applications. Despite the strong progress in this field, there are still challenging situations in which established methods fail. We present an approach to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of established visual localization methods by adding rendered images. In detail, we first use a modern visual SLAM approach that provides a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based map to create reference data. We demonstrate that enriching reference data with images rendered from 3DGS at randomly sampled poses significantly improves the performance of both geometry-based visual localization and Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods. Through comprehensive evaluation in a large industrial environment, we analyze the performance impact of incorporating these additional rendered views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inter3D: A Benchmark and Strong Baseline for Human-Interactive 3D Object Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14004v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in implicit 3D reconstruction methods, e.g., neural rendering fields and Gaussian splatting, have primarily focused on novel view synthesis of static or dynamic objects with continuous motion states. However, these approaches struggle to efficiently model a human-interactive object with n movable parts, requiring 2^n separate models to represent all discrete states. To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts. In addition, we explore two occupancy grid sampling strategies to facilitate training efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark, showcasing the challenges of the task and the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Explicit Representation for Ultra-Realistic Head Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11453v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel approach to creating ultra-realistic head avatars and rendering them in real-time (>30fps at $2048 \times 1334$ resolution). First, we propose a hybrid explicit representation that combines the advantages of two primitive-based efficient rendering techniques. UV-mapped 3D mesh is utilized to capture sharp and rich textures on smooth surfaces, while 3D Gaussian Splatting is employed to represent complex geometric structures. In the pipeline of modeling an avatar, after tracking parametric models based on captured multi-view RGB videos, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the texture and opacity map of mesh, as well as a set of 3D Gaussian splats localized and rigged onto the mesh facets. Specifically, we perform $\alpha$-blending on the color and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffer from the rasterization results of mesh and 3DGS. This process involves the mesh and 3DGS adaptively fitting the captured visual information to outline a high-fidelity digital avatar. To avoid artifacts caused by Gaussian splats crossing the mesh facets, we design a stable hybrid depth sorting strategy. Experiments illustrate that our modeled results exceed those of state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Nevertheless, developing an effective channel modeling approach has been a longstanding challenge. This issue has been escalated due to the denser network deployment, larger antenna arrays, and wider bandwidth in 5G and beyond networks. To address this challenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on wireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting. WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture the interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient WRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The reconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for comprehensive wireless channel characterization. Notably, with a small number of measurements, WRF-GS can synthesize new spatial spectra within milliseconds for a given scene, thereby enabling latency-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate that WRF-GS outperforms existing methods for spatial spectrum synthesis, such as ray tracing and other deep-learning approaches. Moreover, WRF-GS achieves superior performance in the channel state information prediction task, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin of more than 2.43 dB.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM 2025)</p></details> |

Using a set of 3D Gaussians to represent complex geometry and appearance, GS achieves faster rendering times and reduced memory consumption compared to the neural network approach used in NeRF. However, quality assessment of GS-generated static content is not yet explored in-depth. This paper describes a subjective quality assessment study that aims to evaluate synthesized videos obtained with several static GS state-of-the-art methods. The methods were applied to diverse visual scenes, covering both 360-degree and forward-facing (FF) camera trajectories. Moreover, the performance of 18 objective quality metrics was analyzed using the scores resulting from the subjective study, providing insights into their strengths, limitations, and alignment with human perception. All videos and scores are made available providing a comprehensive database that can be used as benchmark on GS view synthesis and objective quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[High-Dynamic Radar Sequence Prediction for Weather Nowcasting Using Spatiotemporal Coherent Gaussian Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14895v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral paper at ICLR 2025.

But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction.

AMD Versal AI Engine is a commercial spatial architecture consisting of tiles of VLIW processors supporting SIMD operations arranged in a two-dimensional mesh. The architecture requires the explicit design of task assignments and dataflow configurations for each tile to maximize performance, demanding advanced techniques and meticulous design. However, a few works revealed the performance characteristics of the Versal AI Engine through practical workloads. In this work, we provide the comprehensive performance evaluation of the Versal AI Engine using Gaussian feature computation in 3D Gaussian splatting as a practical workload, and we then propose a novel dedicated algorithm to fully exploit the hardware architecture. The computations of 3D Gaussian splatting include matrix multiplications and color computations utilizing high-dimensional spherical harmonic coefficients. These tasks are processed efficiently by leveraging the SIMD capabilities and their instruction-level parallelism.

Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.</p></details> | 8 pages |

| **[OMG: Opacity Matters in Material Modeling with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10988v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://denghilbert.github.io/self-cali/</p></details> |

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \textbf{L}arge \textbf{I}mages are \textbf{G}aussians (\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details.

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images</p></details> |  |

In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In response, we propose a platform that leverages a 3D interactive facial avatar capable of displaying non-verbal feedback, including pain signals. This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs</p></details> |

GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</p></details> |  |

However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods.

State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis.

| **[BillBoard Splatting (BBSplat): Learnable Textured Primitives for Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08508v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), preserving the accurate mesh extraction ability of 2D primitives. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11394v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |

This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations.

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

| **[LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</p></details> |  |

An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io/</p></details> |

However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts. Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning. We validate our method's superiority by comparing it against standard distribution estimation methods across five large-scale datasets, demonstrating consistent outperformance. Code, datasets and more information will be publicly available at our project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</p></details> |  |

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

It is compatible with widely-used techniques including SLAM, Multi-View Stereo, and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), enabling accurate 3D reconstructions and point clouds. This makes it a benchmark for reconstruction and segmentation tasks.

However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.</p></details> | 22 pages |

In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website https://weichengtseng.github.io/gs-granular-mani/</p></details> |

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[VoD-3DGS: View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Graph diffusion refines 3D features, such as coarse segmentation masks, by leveraging 3D geometry and pairwise similarities induced by DINOv2. Our approach achieves performance comparable to the state of the art on multiple downstream tasks while delivering significant speed-ups.

More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been explored as a potential method for real-time crowd rendering. In this paper, we present a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment that aims to determine the perceived quality of 3D Gaussian avatars. Three factors were explored: Motion, LOD (i.e., #Gaussians), and the avatar height in Pixels (corresponding to the viewing distance). Participants viewed pairs of animated 3D Gaussian avatars and were tasked with choosing the most detailed one. Our findings can inform the optimization of LOD strategies in Gaussian-based crowd rendering, thereby helping to achieve efficient rendering while maintaining visual quality in real-time applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

The compatibility with image diffusion models enables seamless adaptions of numerous techniques for image generation to the 3D realm.

We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-based methods. Notably, for the first time, splatting-based methods outperform state-of-the-art Neural Radiance Fields, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEP-GS: Perceptually-Enhanced Precise Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05731v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5figures |

To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ChrisDong-THU/GaussianToken.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses the challenge of visualizing objects within large-scale scenes at a high level of detail (LOD) using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The aim is to improve the visual fidelity of chosen objects while maintaining the efficiency of the computations by focusing on details only for relevant content. The proposed ROI-NeRFs framework divides the scene into a Scene NeRF, which represents the overall scene at moderate detail, and multiple ROI NeRFs that focus on user-defined objects of interest. An object-focused camera selection module automatically groups relevant cameras for each NeRF training during the decomposition phase. In the composition phase, a Ray-level Compositional Rendering technique combines information from the Scene NeRF and ROI NeRFs, allowing simultaneous multi-object rendering composition. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, including one on a complex eighteen's century cultural heritage room, demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods, improving LOD for object regions, minimizing artifacts, and without significantly increasing inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including appendix, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces IOVS4NeRF, a framework that employs an uncertainty-guided incremental optimal view selection strategy adaptable to various NeRF implementations. Specifically, by leveraging a hybrid uncertainty model that combines rendering and positional uncertainties, the proposed method calculates the most informative view from among the candidates, thereby enabling incremental optimization of scene reconstruction. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that IOVS4NeRF achieves high-fidelity NeRF reconstruction with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale scene applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.</p></details> | Under review |

In recent years, 3D object generation has made great process and achieved promising results, but it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generating complex, textured, and high-fidelity results. To resolve this problem, we study learning effective NeRFs and SDFs representations with 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D object generation. Specifically, inspired by recent works, we use the efficient geometry-aware 3D GANs as the backbone incorporating with label embedding and color mapping, which enables to train the model on different taxonomies simultaneously. Then, through a decoder, we aggregate the resulting features to generate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) based representations for rendering high-fidelity synthetic images. Meanwhile, we optimize Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to effectively represent objects with 3D meshes. Besides, we observe that this model can be effectively trained with only a few images of each object from a variety of classes, instead of using a great number of images per object or training one model per class. With this pipeline, we can optimize an effective model for 3D object generation. This solution is among the top 3 in the ICCV 2023 OmniObject3D Challenge.</p></details> |  |

Especially, we argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UV-Attack: Physical-World Adversarial Attacks for Person Detection via Dynamic-NeRF-based UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05783v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, submitted to ICLR2025</p></details> |
| **[EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041v4)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</p></details> |  |

Previous attempts either focus on reconstructing single reflective objects or rely on strong supervision guidance in terms of additional user-provided annotations of visible image regions of the mirrors, thereby limiting the practical usability. In contrast, in this paper, we present NeRF-MD, a method which shows that NeRFs can be considered as mirror detectors and which is capable of reconstructing neural radiance fields of scenes containing mirroring surfaces without the need for prior annotations. To this end, we first compute an initial estimate of the scene geometry by training a standard NeRF using a depth reprojection loss. Our key insight lies in the fact that parts of the scene corresponding to a mirroring surface will still exhibit a significant photometric inconsistency, whereas the remaining parts are already reconstructed in a plausible manner. This allows us to detect mirror surfaces by fitting geometric primitives to such inconsistent regions in this initial stage of the training. Using this information, we then jointly optimize the radiance field and mirror geometry in a second training stage to refine their quality. We demonstrate the capability of our method to allow the faithful detection of mirrors in the scene as well as the reconstruction of a single consistent scene representation, and demonstrate its potential in comparison to baseline and mirror-aware approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density for Neural Implicit Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727v2)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in the volume density by modeling uncertainty in the occupancy, without the need for additional networks, making it particularly suited for challenging observations and uncontrolled image environments. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by providing an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in addressing uncertainties solely through geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies when interpreting scenes with insufficient real-world observations. While previous efforts have relied on auxiliary networks, we propose a series of formulation extensions to NeRF that manage uncertainties in density, both color and density, and occupancy, all without the need for additional networks. In experiments, we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset. Given that uncertainty modeling aligns well with the inherently uncertain environments of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we applied our approach to SLAM systems and observed notable improvements in mapping and tracking performance. These results confirm the effectiveness of our Bayesian NeRF approach in quantifying uncertainty based on geometric structure, making it a robust solution for challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Previous works (e.g, NeRF-Det) have demonstrated that implicit representation has the capacity to benefit the visual 3D perception task in indoor scenes with high amount of overlap between input images. However, previous works cannot fully utilize the advancement of implicit representation because of fixed sampling and simple multi-view feature fusion. In this paper, inspired by sparse fashion method (e.g, DETR3D), we propose a simple yet effective method, NeRF-DetS, to address above issues. NeRF-DetS includes two modules: Progressive Adaptive Sampling Strategy (PASS) and Depth-Guided Simplified Multi-Head Attention Fusion (DS-MHA). Specifically, (1)PASS can automatically sample features of each layer within a dense 3D detector, using offsets predicted by the previous layer. (2)DS-MHA can not only efficiently fuse multi-view features with strong occlusion awareness but also reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate our NeRF-DetS outperforms NeRF-Det, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP under IoU25 and IoU50, respectively. Also, NeRF-DetS shows consistent improvements on ARKITScenes.</p></details> |  |

We propose that identifying and establishing fine-grained and generalizable correspondences between driving signals and generated results can simultaneously resolve both problems. Here we present LokiTalk, a novel framework designed to enhance NeRF-based talking heads with lifelike facial dynamics and improved training efficiency. To achieve fine-grained correspondences, we introduce Region-Specific Deformation Fields, which decompose the overall portrait motion into lip movements, eye blinking, head pose, and torso movements. By hierarchically modeling the driving signals and their associated regions through two cascaded deformation fields, we significantly improve dynamic accuracy and minimize synthetic artifacts. Furthermore, we propose ID-Aware Knowledge Transfer, a plug-and-play module that learns generalizable dynamic and static correspondences from multi-identity videos, while simultaneously extracting ID-specific dynamic and static features to refine the depiction of individual characters. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LokiTalk delivers superior high-fidelity results and training efficiency compared to previous methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/LokiTalk/</p></details> |

These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds. Our code will be made publically available.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial vulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat landscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), remains underexplored. This work introduces \textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework for crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \textit{AdvIRL} generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box attacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range of scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g., lighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence misclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a cannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond attacking, \textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as adversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems.

However, the substantial data volumes pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing solutions typically optimize NeRF representation and compression independently or focus on a single fixed rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff. In this paper, we propose VRVVC, a novel end-to-end joint optimization variable-rate framework for volumetric video compression that achieves variable bitrates using a single model while maintaining superior RD performance. Specifically, VRVVC introduces a compact tri-plane implicit residual representation for inter-frame modeling of long-duration dynamic scenes, effectively reducing temporal redundancy. We further propose a variable-rate residual representation compression scheme that leverages a learnable quantization and a tiny MLP-based entropy model. This approach enables variable bitrates through the utilization of predefined Lagrange multipliers to manage the quantization error of all latent representations. Finally, we present an end-to-end progressive training strategy combined with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRVVC achieves a wide range of variable bitrates within a single model and surpasses the RD performance of existing methods across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF-NQA: No-Reference Quality Assessment for Scenes Generated by NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08029v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references. An implementation of this paper are available at https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-NQA.</p></details> |  |

While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

| **[TFS-NeRF: Template-Free NeRF for Semantic 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17459v4)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction, handling dynamic environments with interactions between arbitrary rigid, non-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries.

| **[NeRF Inpainting with Geometric Diffusion Prior and Balanced Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15551v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in NeRF inpainting have leveraged pretrained diffusion models to enhance performance. However, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their ineffective utilization of 2D diffusion priors. The limitations manifest in two critical aspects: the inadequate capture of geometric information by pretrained diffusion models and the suboptimal guidance provided by existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. To address these problems, we introduce GB-NeRF, a novel framework that enhances NeRF inpainting through improved utilization of 2D diffusion priors. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a fine-tuning strategy that simultaneously learns appearance and geometric priors and a specialized normal distillation loss that integrates these geometric priors into NeRF inpainting. We propose a technique called Balanced Score Distillation (BSD) that surpasses existing methods such as Score Distillation (SDS) and the improved version, Conditional Score Distillation (CSD). BSD offers improved inpainting quality in appearance and geometric aspects. Extensive experiments show that our method provides superior appearance fidelity and geometric consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Towards Degradation-Robust Reconstruction in Generalizable NeRF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11691v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) across scenes has been proven to be an effective way to avoid per-scene optimization by representing a scene with deep image features of source images. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, there has been limited research on the robustness of GNeRFs to different types of degradation present in the source images. The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 6th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems</p></details> |

Building on disentangled Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed in varying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can then be applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectively rendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity. Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn various transformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlight not only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practical applications in computer graphics. We publish our method implementation, along with our synthetic/real datasets on https://github.com/astra-vision/BRDFTransform</p></details> |  |
| **[LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06757v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable performances in producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS2023)</p></details> |
| **[Rate-aware Compression for NeRF-based Volumetric Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05322v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICME 2024</p></details> |

Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS)</p></details> |

Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024</p></details> |

However, to the best of our knowledge, existing works do not explicitly model the distribution of training camera poses, or consequently the triangulation quality, a key factor affecting reconstruction quality dating back to classical vision literature. We close this gap with ProvNeRF, an approach that models the \textbf{provenance} for each point -- i.e., the locations where it is likely visible -- of NeRFs as a stochastic field. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional space with an optimizable objective. We show that modeling per-point provenance during the NeRF optimization enriches the model with information on triangulation leading to improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty estimation under the challenging sparse, unconstrained view setting against competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Bringing NeRFs to the Latent Space: Inverse Graphics Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22936v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained image autoencoders are increasingly utilized in computer vision, the application of inverse graphics in 2D latent spaces has been under-explored. Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We experimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved quality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and rendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

| **[Evaluation of strategies for efficient rate-distortion NeRF streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19459v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized the field of 3D visual representation by enabling highly realistic and detailed scene reconstructions from a sparse set of images. NeRF uses a volumetric functional representation that maps 3D points to their corresponding colors and opacities, allowing for photorealistic view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. Despite its advancements, the efficient streaming of NeRF content remains a significant challenge due to the large amount of data involved. This paper investigates the rate-distortion performance of two NeRF streaming strategies: pixel-based and neural network (NN) parameter-based streaming. While in the former, images are coded and then transmitted throughout the network, in the latter, the respective NeRF model parameters are coded and transmitted instead. This work also highlights the trade-offs in complexity and performance, demonstrating that the NN parameter-based strategy generally offers superior efficiency, making it suitable for one-to-many streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This landscape is defined by a NeRF-informed grasp value function. The neural network representing this function is trained on simulated grasp demonstrations. During training, we use an auxiliary loss to guide not only the weight updates of this network but also the update how the slope of the optimization landscape changes. This loss is computed on the demonstrated grasp trajectory and the gradients of the landscape. With second order optimization, we incorporate valuable information from the trajectory as well as facilitate the optimization process of the implicit policy. Experiments demonstrate that employing this auxiliary loss improves policies' performance in simulation as well as their zero-shot transfer to the real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot NeRF by Adaptive Rendering Loss Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17839v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis with sparse inputs poses great challenges to Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Recent works demonstrate that the frequency regularization of Positional Encoding (PE) can achieve promising results for few-shot NeRF. In this work, we reveal that there exists an inconsistency between the frequency regularization of PE and rendering loss. This prevents few-shot NeRF from synthesizing higher-quality novel views. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision. In this way, AR-NeRF can learn global structures better in the early training phase and adaptively learn local details throughout the training process. Extensive experiments show that our AR-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, including object-level and complex scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |
| **[Visual Localization in 3D Maps: Comparing Point Cloud, Mesh, and NeRF Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11966v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in mapping techniques have enabled the creation of highly accurate dense 3D maps during robotic missions, such as point clouds, meshes, or NeRF-based representations. These developments present new opportunities for reusing these maps for localization. However, there remains a lack of a unified approach that can operate seamlessly across different map representations. This paper presents and evaluates a global visual localization system capable of localizing a single camera image across various 3D map representations built using both visual and lidar sensing. Our system generates a database by synthesizing novel views of the scene, creating RGB and depth image pairs. Leveraging the precise 3D geometric map, our method automatically defines rendering poses, reducing the number of database images while preserving retrieval performance. To bridge the domain gap between real query camera images and synthetic database images, our approach utilizes learning-based descriptors and feature detectors. We evaluate the system's performance through extensive real-world experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings, assessing the effectiveness of each map representation and demonstrating its advantages over traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) localization approaches. The results show that all three map representations can achieve consistent localization success rates of 55% and higher across various environments. NeRF synthesized images show superior performance, localizing query images at an average success rate of 72%. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advantage over SfM-based approaches that our synthesized database enables localization in the reverse travel direction which is unseen during the mapping process. Our system, operating in real-time on a mobile laptop equipped with a GPU, achieves a processing rate of 1Hz.</p></details> |  |

In this work, We propose GL-NeRF, a new perspective of computing volume rendering with the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsnerf/ GitHub: https://github.com/dunbar12138/DSNeRF</p></details> |

When combined with human prior knowledge, high-quality human rendering can be achieved even with sparse input views. However, the inference of these methods is still slow, as a large number of neural network queries on each ray are required to ensure the rendering quality. Moreover, occluded regions often suffer from artifacts, especially when the input views are sparse. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable human NeRF framework that achieves high-quality and real-time rendering with sparse input views by extensively leveraging human prior knowledge. We accelerate the rendering with a two-stage sampling reduction strategy: first constructing boundary meshes around the human geometry to reduce the number of ray samples for sampling guidance regression, and then volume rendering using fewer guided samples. To improve rendering quality, especially in occluded regions, we propose an occlusion-aware attention mechanism to extract occlusion information from the human priors, followed by an image space refinement network to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, for volume rendering, we adopt a signed ray distance function (SRDF) formulation, which allows us to propose an SRDF loss at every sample position to improve the rendering quality further. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and has a competitive rendering speed compared with speed-prioritized novel view synthesis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/LarsPh/EG-HumanNeRF</p></details> |

Existing ISAR reconstruction methods including backprojection (BP) often require complex setups and controlled environments, rendering them impractical for many real-world noisy scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Analysis-through-Synthesis (ATS) framework enabled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for high-resolution coherent ISAR imaging of small objects using sparse and noisy Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data with an inexpensive and portable setup. Our end-to-end framework integrates ultra-wideband radar wave propagation, reflection characteristics, and scene priors, enabling efficient 2D scene reconstruction without the need for costly anechoic chambers or complex measurement test beds. With qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques and generates ISAR images of complex scenes with multiple targets and complex structures in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and noisy scenarios, particularly with limited number of views and sparse UWB radar scans. This work represents a significant step towards practical, cost-effective ISAR imaging of small everyday objects, with broad implications for robotics and mobile sensing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

| **[OPONeRF: One-Point-One NeRF for Robust Neural Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20043v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a One-Point-One NeRF (OPONeRF) framework for robust scene rendering. Existing NeRFs are designed based on a key assumption that the target scene remains unchanged between the training and test time. However, small but unpredictable perturbations such as object movements, light changes and data contaminations broadly exist in real-life 3D scenes, which lead to significantly defective or failed rendering results even for the recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework in OPONeRF that adaptively responds to local scene variations via personalizing appropriate point-wise parameters, instead of fitting a single set of NeRF parameters that are inactive to test-time unseen changes. Moreover, to explicitly capture the local uncertainty, we decompose the point representation into deterministic mapping and probabilistic inference. In this way, OPONeRF learns the sharable invariance and unsupervisedly models the unexpected scene variations between the training and testing scenes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct benchmarks from both realistic and synthetic data with diverse test-time perturbations including foreground motions, illumination variations and multi-modality noises, which are more challenging than conventional generalization and temporal reconstruction benchmarks. Experimental results show that our OPONeRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRFs on various evaluation metrics through benchmark experiments and cross-scene evaluations. We further show the efficacy of the proposed method via experimenting on other existing generalization-based benchmarks and incorporating the idea of One-Point-One NeRF into other advanced baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and dataset: https://yzheng97.github.io/OPONeRF/</p></details> |

Despite demonstrating impressive rendering speed and quality, the rapid convergence of such models poses challenges for further improving reconstruction quality. Common strategies to improve rendering quality involves augmenting model parameters or increasing the number of sampled points. However, these computationally intensive approaches encounter limitations in achieving significant quality enhancements. This study introduces a model-agnostic framework inspired by Sparsely-Gated Mixture of Experts to enhance rendering quality without escalating computational complexity. Our approach enables specialization in rendering different scene components by employing a mixture of experts with varying resolutions. We present a novel gate formulation designed to maximize expert capabilities and propose a resolution-based routing technique to effectively induce sparsity and decompose scenes. Our work significantly improves reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to the ECCV 2024 conference</p></details> |

Existing research has proposed the integration of explicit geometric proxies to enable deformation. However, these methods face two primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks.

However, a collaborative approach requires a distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with less accurate relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

| **[Distributed NeRF Learning for Collaborative Multi-Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20289v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective environment perception is crucial for enabling downstream robotic applications. Individual robotic agents often face occlusion and limited visibility issues, whereas multi-agent systems can offer a more comprehensive mapping of the environment, quicker coverage, and increased fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a collaborative multi-agent perception system where agents collectively learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) from posed RGB images to represent a scene. Each agent processes its local sensory data and shares only its learned NeRF model with other agents, reducing communication overhead. Given NeRF's low memory footprint, this approach is well-suited for robotic systems with limited bandwidth, where transmitting all raw data is impractical. Our distributed learning framework ensures consistency across agents' local NeRF models, enabling convergence to a unified scene representation. We show the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments on datasets containing challenging real-world scenes, achieving performance comparable to centralized mapping of the environment where data is sent to a central server for processing. Additionally, we find that multi-agent learning provides regularization benefits, improving geometric consistency in scenarios with sparse input views. We show that in such scenarios, multi-agent mapping can even outperform centralized training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints. This capability has significant advantages for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling, and content creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics. This paper addresses the problem of NeRF view synthesis (NVS) quality assessment thoroughly, by conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several scene classes and recently proposed NVS methods. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. This study found that errors in camera pose estimation can result in spatial misalignments between synthesized and reference images, which need to be corrected before applying an objective quality metric. The experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation of several NVS methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and 360-degree camera trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[CompoNeRF: Text-guided Multi-object Compositional NeRF with Editable 3D Scene Layout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13843v5)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D form plays a crucial role in creating editable 3D scenes for AR/VR. Recent advances have shown promise in merging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However, one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of 'guidance collapse' and further enhance scene consistency, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object-specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a complex text into the layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next, a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts accuracy. Noticeably, our composition design permits decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open-source Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF generates multi-object scenes with high fidelity. Remarkably, our framework achieves up to a \textbf{54\%} improvement by the multi-view CLIP score metric. Our user study indicates that our method has significantly improved semantic accuracy, multi-view consistency, and individual recognizability for multi-object scene generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ternary-Type Opacity and Hybrid Odometry for RGB NeRF-SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the challenge of deploying Neural Radiance Field (NeRFs) in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) under the condition of lacking depth information, relying solely on RGB inputs. The key to unlocking the full potential of NeRF in such a challenging context lies in the integration of real-world priors. A crucial prior we explore is the binary opacity prior of 3D space with opaque objects. To effectively incorporate this prior into the NeRF framework, we introduce a ternary-type opacity (TT) model instead, which categorizes points on a ray intersecting a surface into three regions: before, on, and behind the surface. This enables a more accurate rendering of depth, subsequently improving the performance of image warping techniques. Therefore, we further propose a novel hybrid odometry (HO) scheme that merges bundle adjustment and warping-based localization. Our integrated approach of TT and HO achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, in terms of both speed and accuracy. This breakthrough underscores the potential of NeRF-SLAM in navigating complex environments with high fidelity.</p></details> | IROS 2024 |
| **[NeRF-Supervised Feature Point Detection and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08156v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instant Uncertainty Calibration of NeRFs Using a Meta-Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02350v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have markedly improved novel view synthesis, accurate uncertainty quantification in their image predictions remains an open problem. The prevailing methods for estimating uncertainty, including the state-of-the-art Density-aware NeRF Ensembles (DANE) [29], quantify uncertainty without calibration. This frequently leads to over- or under-confidence in image predictions, which can undermine their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method which, for the first time, achieves calibrated uncertainties for NeRFs. To accomplish this, we overcome a significant challenge in adapting existing calibration techniques to NeRFs: a need to hold out ground truth images from the target scene, reducing the number of images left to train the NeRF. This issue is particularly problematic in sparse-view settings, where we can operate with as few as three images. To address this, we introduce the concept of a meta-calibrator that performs uncertainty calibration for NeRFs with a single forward pass without the need for holding out any images from the target scene. Our meta-calibrator is a neural network that takes as input the NeRF images and uncalibrated uncertainty maps and outputs a scene-specific calibration curve that corrects the NeRF's uncalibrated uncertainties. We show that the meta-calibrator can generalize on unseen scenes and achieves well-calibrated and state-of-the-art uncertainty for NeRFs, significantly beating DANE and other approaches. This opens opportunities to improve applications that rely on accurate NeRF uncertainty estimates such as next-best view planning and potentially more trustworthy image reconstruction for medical diagnosis.

Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit-NeRF-QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics. The dataset, including NeRF samples, source 3D objects, multiview images for NeRF generation, PVSs, MOS, is made publicly available at the following location: https://github.com/YukeXing/Explicit-NeRF-QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> |

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects. By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024.

This constrained data requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users. In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method. Our contribution is not only in extending the capabilities of existing techniques but also in establishing a foundation for scalable and efficient large-scale scene representation using NeRF and octree structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, version accepted by Siggraph Asia</p></details> |

In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call \textit{NeRFmentation}, trains NeRFs on each scene in a dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset, KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving dataset, and our own synthetic test set.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses key challenges in multi-robot 3D reconstruction, including inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. We introduce a method for using wireless Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and ranging measurements to estimate relative poses between robots, as well as quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty embedded in the wireless localization of these pose estimates into the NeRF training loss to mitigate the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Furthermore, we propose an active view selection approach that accounts for robot pose uncertainty when determining the next-best views to improve the 3D reconstruction, enabling faster convergence through intelligent view selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in theory and in practice. Leveraging wireless coordination and localization uncertainty-aware training, MULAN-WC can achieve high-quality 3d reconstruction which is close to applying the ground truth camera poses. Furthermore, the quantification of the information gain from a novel view enables consistent rendering quality improvement with incrementally captured images by commending the robot the novel view position. Our hardware experiments showcase the practicality of deploying MULAN-WC to real robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of predicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide enough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries yielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision during NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be perfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more challenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in depth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or uncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know that depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through L2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth metrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'24), October 14-18, 2024, Salt Lake City, UT, USA</p></details> |

MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry. Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our method achieves SOTA performance.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which provide the current benchmark in terms of quality for the generation of novel views of complex 3D scenes from a limited set of 2D images, represent a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training of these models requires the knowledge of the respective camera positions from which the images were viewed. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing HyperNeRFGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture employing a hypernetwork paradigm to transform a Gaussian noise into the weights of a NeRF architecture that does not utilize viewing directions in its training phase. Consequently, as evidenced by the findings of our experimental study, the proposed model, despite its notable simplicity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrates superior performance on a diverse range of image datasets where camera position estimation is challenging, particularly in the context of medical data.</p></details> |  |

Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p></details> | ECCV24 camera ready |

Previous solutions for learning NeRFs with sparse views and noisy poses only consider local geometry consistency with pairs of views. Closely following \textit{bundle adjustment} in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), we introduce TrackNeRF for more globally consistent geometry reconstruction and more accurate pose optimization. TrackNeRF introduces \textit{feature tracks}, \ie connected pixel trajectories across \textit{all} visible views that correspond to the \textit{same} 3D points. By enforcing reprojection consistency among feature tracks, TrackNeRF encourages holistic 3D consistency explicitly. Through extensive experiments, TrackNeRF sets a new benchmark in noisy and sparse view reconstruction. In particular, TrackNeRF shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art BARF and SPARF by $\sim8$ and $\sim1$ in terms of PSNR on DTU under various sparse and noisy view setups.

However, the occlusion of invisible voxels by scene surfaces poses challenges to current SSC methods in hallucinating refined 3D geometry. This paper proposes HybridOcc, a hybrid 3D volume query proposal method generated by Transformer framework and NeRF representation and refined in a coarse-to-fine SSC prediction framework. HybridOcc aggregates contextual features through the Transformer paradigm based on hybrid query proposals while combining it with NeRF representation to obtain depth supervision. The Transformer branch contains multiple scales and uses spatial cross-attention for 2D to 3D transformation. The newly designed NeRF branch implicitly infers scene occupancy through volume rendering, including visible and invisible voxels, and explicitly captures scene depth rather than generating RGB color. Furthermore, we present an innovative occupancy-aware ray sampling method to orient the SSC task instead of focusing on the scene surface, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HybridOcc on the SSC task.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE RAL |

Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to reconstruct the dynamic scenes and struggle to fit even the training views in unsynchronized settings. It happens because they employ a single latent embedding for a frame while the multi-view images at the same frame were actually captured at different moments. To address this limitation, we introduce time offsets for individual unsynchronized videos and jointly optimize the offsets with NeRF. By design, our method is applicable for various baselines and improves them with large margins. Furthermore, finding the offsets naturally works as synchronizing the videos without manual effort. Experiments are conducted on the common Plenoptic Video Dataset and a newly built Unsynchronized Dynamic Blender Dataset to verify the performance of our method.

However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually fail to capture the complex geometric details of plants, which is crucial for phenotyping and breeding studies. We evaluate the reconstruction fidelity of NeRFs in three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.6% F1 score after 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficacy of NeRFs for 3D reconstruction in challenging environments. Additionally, we propose an early stopping technique for NeRF training that almost halves the training time while achieving only a reduction of 7.4% in the average F1 score. This optimization process significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of 3D reconstruction using NeRFs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of NeRFs in detailed and realistic 3D plant reconstruction and suggest practical approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency of NeRFs in the 3D reconstruction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 'Plant Phenomics'</p></details> |

NeRF models produce state-of-the-art quality for many 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks but require substantial computational resources. The encoding of the scene information within the NeRF network parameters necessitates stochastic sampling. We observe that during the training, a major part of the compute time and memory usage is spent on processing already learnt samples, which no longer affect the model update significantly. We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph. As our method only interfaces with the network module, we expect it to be widely applicable.</p></details> |  |

While many works have focused on generating 3D human models, they suffer one or more of the following: lack of distinctive features, unnatural shading/shadows, unnatural poses/clothes, limited views, etc. InceptionHuman achieves consistent 3D human generation within a progressively refined NeRF space with two novel modules, Iterative Pose-Aware Refinement (IPAR) and Progressive-Augmented Reconstruction (PAR). IPAR iteratively refines the diffusion-generated images and synthesizes high-quality 3D-aware views considering the close-pose RGB values. PAR employs a pretrained diffusion prior to augment the generated synthetic views and adds regularization for view-independent appearance. Overall, the synthesis of photorealistic novel views empowers the resulting 3D human NeRF from 360-degree perspectives. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison show that our InceptionHuman models achieve state-of-the-art application quality.</p></details> |  |

Although there are extensive works on image-level attacks, most are restricted to 2D pixel spaces, and such attacks are not always physically realistic in our 3D world. Here we present Adv3D, the first exploration of modeling adversarial examples as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Advances in NeRF provide photorealistic appearances and 3D accurate generation, yielding a more realistic and realizable adversarial example. We train our adversarial NeRF by minimizing the surrounding objects' confidence predicted by 3D detectors on the training set. Then we evaluate Adv3D on the unseen validation set and show that it can cause a large performance reduction when rendering NeRF in any sampled pose. To generate physically realizable adversarial examples, we propose primitive-aware sampling and semantic-guided regularization that enable 3D patch attacks with camouflage adversarial texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained adversarial NeRF generalizes well to different poses, scenes, and 3D detectors. Finally, we provide a defense method to our attacks that involves adversarial training through data augmentation. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/adv3d-web</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these techniques to edit scenes in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is complex, as editing individual 2D frames can result in inconsistencies across multiple views. Our crucial insight is that a NeRF scene's geometry can serve as a bridge to integrate these 2D edits. Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges. Our results reveal that this methodology achieves more consistent, lifelike, and detailed edits than existing leading methods for text-driven NeRF scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D Sc...</summary><p>3D Scene Editing, Neural Rendering, Diffusion Models, Accepted to ECCV24</p></details> |

Traditionally, 3D mapping, or scene reconstruction, has relied on expensive LiDAR sensing. Photogrammetry can perform image-based 3D reconstruction but is computationally expensive and requires extremely dense image representation to recover complex geometry and photorealism. NeRFs perform 3D scene reconstruction by training a neural network on sparse image and pose data, achieving superior results to photogrammetry with less input data. This paper presents an evaluation of two NeRF scene reconstructions for the purpose of estimating the diameter of a vertical PVC cylinder. One of these are trained on commodity iPhone data and the other is trained on robot-sourced imagery and poses. This neural-geometry is compared to state-of-the-art lidar-inertial SLAM in terms of scene noise and metric-accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios.

Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.</p></details> | accepted to eccv2024 |

Rather than developing hard-to-combine and specific modules, another approach generally overlooked is to directly inject generic priors on the scene representation (also called inductive biases) into the NeRF architecture. Based on this idea, we propose the RING-NeRF architecture which includes two inductive biases : a continuous multi-scale representation of the scene and an invariance of the decoder's latent space over spatial and scale domains. We also design a single reconstruction process that takes advantage of those inductive biases and experimentally demonstrates on-par performances in terms of quality with dedicated architecture on multiple tasks (anti-aliasing, few view reconstruction, SDF reconstruction without scene-specific initialization) while being more efficient. Moreover, RING-NeRF has the distinctive ability to dynamically increase the resolution of the model, opening the way to adaptive reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This publication has been accepted at ECCV'24</p></details> |

While gradient-based optimization in a NeRF framework updates the initial pose, this paper highlights that scale-depth ambiguity in monocular object reconstruction causes failures when the initial pose deviates moderately from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present SUP-NeRF, a Streamlined Unification of object Pose estimation and NeRF-based object reconstruction. SUP-NeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces a camera-invariant projected-box representation that generalizes cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, SUP-NeRF is free from external 3D detectors. SUP-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, SUP-NeRF exhibits exceptional cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50\% reduction in rotation and translation error.</p></details> |  |

Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration. Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field (NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model. Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset, Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper reproduction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Key to our approach are: (i) a dynamic hypernetwork, which learns a smooth mapping from text token embeddings to the space of NeRFs; (ii) NeRF distillation training, which distills scenes encoded in individual NeRFs into one dynamic hypernetwork. These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes -- either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024, Project page: https://threedle.github.io/hyperfields/</p></details> |

Recent NeRFs utilize feature grids to improve rendering quality and speed; however, these representations introduce significant storage overhead. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently compressing a grid-based NeRF model, addressing the storage overhead concern. Our approach is based on the non-linear transform coding paradigm, employing neural compression for compressing the model's feature grids. Due to the lack of training data involving many i.i.d scenes, we design an encoder-free, end-to-end optimized approach for individual scenes, using lightweight decoders. To leverage the spatial inhomogeneity of the latent feature grids, we introduce an importance-weighted rate-distortion objective and a sparse entropy model employing a masking mechanism. Our experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing works in terms of grid-based NeRF compression efficacy and reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[NeRF Director: Revisiting View Selection in Neural Volume Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08839v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Rendering representations have significantly contributed to the field of 3D computer vision. Given their potential, considerable efforts have been invested to improve their performance. Nonetheless, the essential question of selecting training views is yet to be thoroughly investigated. This key aspect plays a vital role in achieving high-quality results and aligns with the well-known tenet of deep learning: "garbage in, garbage out". In this paper, we first illustrate the importance of view selection by demonstrating how a simple rotation of the test views within the most pervasive NeRF dataset can lead to consequential shifts in the performance rankings of state-of-the-art techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a unified framework for view selection methods and devise a thorough benchmark to assess its impact. Significant improvements can be achieved without leveraging error or uncertainty estimation but focusing on uniform view coverage of the reconstructed object, resulting in a training-free approach. Using this technique, we show that high-quality renderings can be achieved faster by using fewer views. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and realistic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with random, conventional error-based, and uncertainty-guided view selection.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |
| **[Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729v5)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Lifting of Multiview to 3D from Unknown Pose: Wrapping NeRF inside Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06972v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We cast multiview reconstruction from unknown pose as a generative modeling problem. From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Can We Compress Instant-NGP-Based NeRF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04101v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing 3D scenes. To expedite the rendering process, learnable explicit representations have been introduced for combination with implicit NeRF representation, which however results in a large storage space requirement. In this paper, we introduce the Context-based NeRF Compression (CNC) framework, which leverages highly efficient context models to provide a storage-friendly NeRF representation. Specifically, we excavate both level-wise and dimension-wise context dependencies to enable probability prediction for information entropy reduction. Additionally, we exploit hash collision and occupancy grids as strong prior knowledge for better context modeling. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct and exploit context models for NeRF compression. We achieve a size reduction of 100$\times$ and 70$\times$ with improved fidelity against the baseline Instant-NGP on Synthesic-NeRF and Tanks and Temples datasets, respectively. Additionally, we attain 86.7\% and 82.3\% storage size reduction against the SOTA NeRF compression method BiRF.

However, the scalability and accuracy of the inferred geometry are not well-documented for large-scale aerial assets,since such datasets usually result in very high memory consumption and slow convergence.. In this paper, we aim to scale the NeRF on large-scael aerial datasets and provide a thorough geometry assessment of NeRF. Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image loading for RAM, representation training for GPU memory, and increase the convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a loss of accuracy. We implement our method on a representative approach, Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS pipelines on two typical aerial datasets against LiDAR reference data. Both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the proposed NeRF approach produces better completeness and object details than traditional approaches, although as of now, it still falls short in terms of accuracy.</p></details> | 9 Figure |

Existing methods manage controlled environments and low occlusion ratios but fall short in render quality, especially under high occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we introduce NeRF On-the-go, a simple yet effective approach that enables the robust synthesis of novel views in complex, in-the-wild scenes from only casually captured image sequences. Delving into uncertainty, our method not only efficiently eliminates distractors, even when they are predominant in captures, but also achieves a notably faster convergence speed. Through comprehensive experiments on various scenes, our method demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art techniques. This advancement opens new avenues for NeRF in diverse and dynamic real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024, first two authors contributed equally.

Standard simulator-based rendering often fails to accurately reflect real-world performance due to the sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between virtual simulations and real-world conditions. To mitigate this gap, we propose a workflow for building a high-fidelity simulation environment of the targeted real-world scene using NeRF. This approach is capable of rendering realistic images from novel viewpoints and constructing 3D meshes for emulating collisions. The validation of these capabilities through the comparison of success rates in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the benefits of using DriveEnv-NeRF as a real-world performance indicator. Furthermore, the DriveEnv-NeRF framework can serve as a training environment for autonomous driving agents under various lighting conditions. This approach enhances the robustness of the agents and reduces performance degradation when deployed to the target real scene, compared to agents fully trained using the standard simulator rendering pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/muyishen2040/DriveEnvNeRF</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning for Efficient NeRF Architecture Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04012v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted as practical and versatile representations for 3D scenes, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, different architectures, including the plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their combinations, entail distinct trade-offs. For instance, representations based on Hashtables enable faster rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, thereby posing challenges for spatial-relation-aware editing. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any conversion between diverse architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the rendering process. Additionally, a three-level active learning technique provides continuous feedback from teacher to student during the distillation process, achieving high-performance outcomes. Experimental evidence showcases the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmark datasets. For instance, PVD-AL can distill an MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and 0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the MLP-based model from scratch. Moreover, PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures, enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient model to meet real-time requirements like mobile devices.

After the first research of NeRF is proposed, NeRF has gained a robust developing power and is booming in the 3D modeling, representation and reconstruction areas. However the first and most of the followed research projects based on NeRF is static, which are weak in the practical applications. Therefore, more researcher are interested and focused on the study of dynamic NeRF that is more feasible and useful in practical applications or situations. Compared with the static NeRF, implementing the Dynamic NeRF is more difficult and complex. But Dynamic is more potential in the future even is the basic of Editable NeRF. In this review, we made a detailed and abundant statement for the development and important implementation principles of Dynamci NeRF. The analysis of main principle and development of Dynamic NeRF is from 2021 to 2023, including the most of the Dynamic NeRF projects. What is more, with colorful and novel special designed figures and table, We also made a detailed comparison and analysis of different features of various of Dynamic. Besides, we analyzed and discussed the key methods to implement a Dynamic NeRF. The volume of the reference papers is large. The statements and comparisons are multidimensional. With a reading of this review, the whole development history and most of the main design method or principles of Dynamic NeRF can be easy understood and gained.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Point Resampling and Ray Transformation Aid to Editable NeRF Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07306v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In NeRF-aided editing tasks, object movement presents difficulties in supervision generation due to the introduction of variability in object positions. Moreover, the removal operations of certain scene objects often lead to empty regions, presenting challenges for NeRF models in inpainting them effectively. We propose an implicit ray transformation strategy, allowing for direct manipulation of the 3D object's pose by operating on the neural-point in NeRF rays. To address the challenge of inpainting potential empty regions, we present a plug-and-play inpainting module, dubbed differentiable neural-point resampling (DNR), which interpolates those regions in 3D space at the original ray locations within the implicit space, thereby facilitating object removal & scene inpainting tasks. Importantly, employing DNR effectively narrows the gap between ground truth and predicted implicit features, potentially increasing the mutual information (MI) of the features across rays. Then, we leverage DNR and ray transformation to construct a point-based editable NeRF pipeline PR^2T-NeRF. Results primarily evaluated on 3D object removal & inpainting tasks indicate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our pipeline supports high-quality rendering visualization for diverse editing operations without necessitating extra supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, they often require to maintain optimizer states throughout training, which can result in memory requirements several times greater than the model footprint. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in contrast, is a stateless optimizer, as it does not track state variables during training. Consequently, it achieves optimal memory efficiency. However, its capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b). In this work, we show that pre-processing SGD in a stateless manner can achieve the same performance as the Adam optimizer for LLM training, while drastically reducing the memory cost. Specifically, we propose to pre-process the instantaneous stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening. We show that normalization stabilizes gradient distributions, and whitening counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any optimizer states. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates comparable or even better performance than Adam: when pre-training the LLaMA model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity using half as many tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>In v2...</summary><p>In v2 we have revised the related work, added more comprehensive citations, and clarified our key contributions</p></details> |

Beyond this, PII may be added or removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques, because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as $\approx\!7.5\times$); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII regurgitation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 26 figures |

However, existing methods assume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client scenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant mediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform LEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection and reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the computed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based MKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine similarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains over 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly outperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we find that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our FedEdit framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/zongkaiz/FLEKE.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to Theory of Mind reasoning either rely on prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), which are prone to systematic errors, or use rigid, handcrafted Bayesian Theory of Mind (BToM) models, which are more robust but cannot generalize across different domains. In this work, we introduce AutoToM, an automated Bayesian Theory of Mind method for achieving open-ended machine Theory of Mind. AutoToM can operate in any domain, infer any mental variable, and conduct robust Theory of Mind reasoning of any order. Given a Theory of Mind inference problem, AutoToM first proposes an initial BToM model. It then conducts automated Bayesian inverse planning based on the proposed model, leveraging an LLM as the backend. Based on the uncertainty of the inference, it iteratively refines the model, by introducing additional mental variables and/or incorporating more timesteps in the context. Empirical evaluations across multiple Theory of Mind benchmarks demonstrate that AutoToM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a scalable, robust, and interpretable approach to machine Theory of Mind.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables.

Current large language model approaches for zero-shot domain adaptation rely on prompting to introduce knowledge pertaining to the target domains. However, their efficacy strongly depends on prompt engineering, as well as the zero-shot ability of the underlying language model. In this work, we devise a novel data augmentation approach, Schema Augmentation, that improves the zero-shot domain adaptation of language models through fine-tuning. Schema Augmentation is a simple but effective technique that enhances generalization by introducing variations of slot names within the schema provided in the prompt. Experiments on MultiWOZ and SpokenWOZ showed that the proposed approach resulted in a substantial improvement over the baseline, in some experiments achieving over a twofold accuracy gain over unseen domains while maintaining equal or superior performance over all domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>short...</summary><p>short paper (4 pages) submitted to ARR</p></details> |

However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Misclassification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate eleven state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains $11.7K$ samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently misclassify even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.</p></details> | 17 pages, 17 figures |

However, most state-of-the-art large pretrained language models predict subword tokens of variable length. We investigate how to practically use such models to make accurate and efficient character predictions. We fine-tune models using a large dataset of sentences we curated in which each sentence is rated according to how useful it might be for spoken or written AAC communication. We find that using an algorithm to produce character predictions from a subword large language model provides more accurate predictions than adding a classification layer or using a byte-level model. We also find that our domain adaptation procedure is effective at improving model performance on simple, conversational text.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine-generated text detection prevents language model collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15654v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their generated outputs are proliferating across the web, risking a future where machine-generated content dilutes human-authored text. Since web data is the primary resource for LLM pretraining, future models will be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic data. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process which causes models to reinforce their own errors and experience a drop in model performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, where we analyse the characteristics of the generated data during recursive training, its similarity to human references and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant model degradation, we tackle the question: how to avoid model collapse when the origin (human or synthetic) of the training data is unknown. We design a novel methodology based on resampling the data distribution using importance weights from our machine-generated text detector. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2) on the open-ended text generation task, demonstrating that we can successfully prevent model collapse and when there is enough human-authored data in the training dataset, our method improves model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper summarizes and categorizes the main challenges into two aspects: (1) Logical question answering, LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises and constrains. (2) Logical consistency, LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw question-answering LLM answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose detailed taxonomies of these methods. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, pretraining, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistency, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extensions to modal logic to account for uncertainty, and efficient algorithms satisfying multiple logical consistencies simultaneously.</p></details> |  |

We propose Simultaneous Weighted Preference Optimization (SWEPO), which incorporates multiple responses per query and prioritizes those that deviate most from the average reward. This deviation-based weighting focuses training on the most informative outliers, akin to a built-in curriculum. Theoretically, we prove that such multi-preference sampling lowers alignment bias, bounding the expected deviation from the true acceptable-response distribution at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$. Empirically, SWEPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the Ultra-Feedback dataset and demonstrates substantial improvements over DPO and InfoNCA, yielding boosts of up to $\sim 4$% on length-controlled win-rate on AlpacaEval.</p></details> |  |

Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.</p></details> | 34 pages |

However, many open questions remain regarding the interplay between reasoning token usage and accuracy gains. In particular, when comparing models across generations, it is unclear whether improved performance results from longer reasoning chains or more efficient reasoning. We systematically analyze chain-of-thought length across o1-mini and o3-mini variants on the Omni-MATH benchmark, finding that o3-mini (m) achieves superior accuracy without requiring longer reasoning chains than o1-mini. Moreover, we show that accuracy generally declines as reasoning chains grow across all models and compute settings, even when controlling for difficulty of the questions. This accuracy drop is significantly smaller in more proficient models, suggesting that new generations of reasoning models use test-time compute more effectively. Finally, we highlight that while o3-mini (h) achieves a marginal accuracy gain over o3-mini (m), it does so by allocating substantially more reasoning tokens across all problems, even the ones that o3-mini (m) can already solve. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between model capability and reasoning length, with implications for efficiency, scaling, and evaluation methodologies.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Towards Automated Penetration Testing: Introducing LLM Benchmark, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17141v4)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, automated, end-to-end penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while LLama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing end-to-end penetration testing even with some minimal human assistance. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper 1-9 pages, Supplementary Materials: 10-17, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Probe Pruning: Accelerating LLMs through Dynamic Pruning via Model-Probing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15618v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of FLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.

Our bootstrapping philosophy is to progressively adapt heterogeneous comprehension and generation knowledge to pre-trained large language models (LLMs). This is achieved through a novel heterogeneous low-rank adaptation (H-LoRA) technique, which is complemented by a tailored hierarchical visual perception approach and a three-stage learning strategy. To effectively learn the HealthGPT, we devise a comprehensive medical domain-specific comprehension and generation dataset called VL-Health.

| **[Large Language Models for Interpretable Mental Health Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07653v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for mental health diagnosis that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and constraint logic programming (CLP). Having a CDSS is important because of the high complexity of diagnostic manuals used by mental health professionals and the danger of diagnostic errors. Our CDSS is a software tool that uses an LLM to translate diagnostic manuals to a logic program and solves the program using an off-the-shelf CLP engine to query a patient's diagnosis based on the encoded rules and provided data. By giving domain experts the opportunity to inspect the LLM-generated logic program, and making modifications when needed, our CDSS ensures that the diagnosis is not only accurate but also interpretable. We experimentally compare it with two baseline approaches of using LLMs: diagnosing patients using the LLM-only approach, and using the LLM-generated logic program but without expert inspection. The results show that, while LLMs are extremely useful in generating candidate logic programs, these programs still require expert inspection and modification to guarantee faithfulness to the official diagnostic manuals. Additionally, ethical concerns arise from the direct use of patient data in LLMs, underscoring the need for a safer hybrid approach like our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025 Workshop on Large Language Models and Generative AI for Health (GenAI4Health)</p></details> |

However, their predictions can be disrupted by factually correct context, a phenomenon known as context hijacking, revealing a significant robustness issue. To understand this phenomenon theoretically, we explore an in-context linear classification problem based on recent advances in linear transformers. In our setup, context tokens are designed as factually correct query-answer pairs, where the queries are similar to the final query but have opposite labels. Then, we develop a general theoretical analysis on the robustness of the linear transformers, which is formulated as a function of the model depth, training context lengths, and number of hijacking context tokens. A key finding is that a well-trained deeper transformer can achieve higher robustness, which aligns with empirical observations. We show that this improvement arises because deeper layers enable more fine-grained optimization steps, effectively mitigating interference from context hijacking. This is also well supported by our numerical experiments. Our findings provide theoretical insights into the benefits of deeper architectures and contribute to enhancing the understanding of transformer architectures.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students toward completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents holistically using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our results and findings can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for a variety of tasks.</p></details> |  |

We assessed the performance of eight LLMs, emphasizing key metrics such as response speed and accuracy, which were quantified using BLEU and METEOR scores. Our findings reveal that advanced models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini significantly outperform their counterparts, particularly when addressing complex queries requiring multi-format data integration. The results validate the system's ability to deliver timely and accurate responses, highlighting the potential of RAG frameworks to optimize maintenance operations. Future research will focus on refining retrieval techniques for these models and enhancing response generation, particularly for intricate scenarios, ultimately improving the system's practical applicability in dynamic real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

However, we show that current LLMs make key decisions in a representation space closest to English, regardless of their input and output languages. Exploring the internal representations with a logit lens for sentences in French, German, Dutch, and Mandarin, we show that the LLM first emits representations close to English for semantically-loaded words before translating them into the target language. We further show that activation steering in these LLMs is more effective when the steering vectors are computed in English rather than in the language of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that multilingual LLMs perform key reasoning steps in a representation that is heavily shaped by English in a way that is not transparent to system users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper 9 pages; including appendix 48 pages</p></details> |

To democratize this process, we introduce WorldCraft, a system where large language model (LLM) agents leverage procedural generation to create indoor and outdoor scenes populated with objects, allowing users to control individual object attributes and the scene layout using intuitive natural language commands. In our framework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two specialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation: ForgeIt, which integrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise customization of individual objects, and ArrangeIt, which formulates hierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic and aesthetic considerations. Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a trajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the camera through natural language interactions. Our system is also compatible with off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets. Through evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the versatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to intricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs. This system empowers non-professionals to bring their creative visions to life.</p></details> |  |

Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to induce undesirable behavior, posing a significant threat to LLM safety. Previous defenses often fail to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. Defenses from a representation perspective offer new insights, but existing interventions cannot dynamically adjust representations based on the harmfulness of the queries. To address this limitation while ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency, we propose SafeIntervention (SafeInt), a novel defense method that shields LLMs from jailbreak attacks through safety-aware representation intervention. SafeInt is built on our analysis of the representations of jailbreak samples. It adjusts representation distributions of jailbreak samples through intervention to align them with the representations of unsafe samples while minimizing unnecessary perturbations to jailbreak-irrelevant representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments covering six jailbreak attacks, two jailbreak datasets, and two utility benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SafeInt outperforms all baselines in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks while largely maintaining utility. Additionally, we evaluate SafeInt against adaptive attacks and verify its effectiveness in mitigating real-time attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing From Short to Long: Effective Data Synthesis for Long-Context Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15592v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-context modelling for large language models (LLMs) has been a key area of recent research because many real world use cases require reasoning over longer inputs such as documents. The focus of research into modelling long context has been on how to model position and there has been little investigation into other important aspects of language modelling such as instruction tuning. Long context training examples are challenging and expensive to create and use. In this paper, we investigate how to design instruction data for the post-training phase of a long context pre-trained model: how much and what type of context is needed for optimal and efficient post-training. Our controlled study reveals that models instruction-tuned on short contexts can effectively generalize to longer ones, while also identifying other critical factors such as instruction difficulty and context composition. Based on these findings, we propose context synthesis, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs to generate extended background contexts for high-quality instruction-answer pairs. Experiment results on the document-level benchmark (LongBench) demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms previous instruction synthesis approaches and comes close to the performance of human-annotated long-context instruction data.

The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study -- using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the original data.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code will be released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.</p></details> |  |

However, in dynamic domains like smart grids, conventional retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) Q&A systems face challenges such as inadequate retrieval quality, irrelevant responses, and inefficiencies in handling large-scale, real-time data streams. This paper proposes an optimized iterative retrieval-based Q&A framework called Chats-Grid tailored for smart grid environments. In the pre-retrieval phase, Chats-Grid advanced query expansion ensures comprehensive coverage of diverse data sources, including sensor readings, meter records, and control system parameters. During retrieval, Best Matching 25(BM25) sparse retrieval and BAAI General Embedding(BGE) dense retrieval in Chats-Grid are combined to process vast, heterogeneous datasets effectively. Post-retrieval, a fine-tuned large language model uses prompt engineering to assess relevance, filter irrelevant results, and reorder documents based on contextual accuracy. The model further generates precise, context-aware answers, adhering to quality criteria and employing a self-checking mechanism for enhanced reliability. Experimental results demonstrate Chats-Grid's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, contextual recall, relevance, and accuracy by 2.37%, 2.19%, and 3.58% respectively. This framework advances smart grid management by improving decision-making and user interactions, fostering resilient and adaptive smart grid infrastructures.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results underscore the need for a nuanced approach when applying LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Technology, Knowledge, and Learning (TKNL)</p></details> |

Understanding their internal states is crucial for understanding their successes, diagnosing their failures, and refining their capabilities. Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise for interpreting LLM internal representations, limited research has explored how to better explain SAE features, i.e., understanding the semantic meaning of features learned by SAE. Our theoretical analysis reveals that existing explanation methods suffer from the frequency bias issue, where they emphasize linguistic patterns over semantic concepts, while the latter is more critical to steer LLM behaviors. To address this, we propose using a fixed vocabulary set for feature interpretations and designing a mutual information-based objective, aiming to better capture the semantic meaning behind these features. We further propose two runtime steering strategies that adjust the learned feature activations based on their corresponding explanations. Empirical results show that, compared to baselines, our method provides more discourse-level explanations and effectively steers LLM behaviors to defend against jailbreak attacks. These findings highlight the value of explanations for steering LLM behaviors in downstream applications. We will release our code and data once accepted.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print. 20 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

We focus on retrieval-based SD where the draft model retrieves the next tokens from a non-parametric datastore. Sparse retrieval (REST), which operates on the surface form of strings, is currently the dominant paradigm due to its simplicity and scalability. However, its effectiveness is limited due to the usage of short contexts and exact string matching. Instead, we introduce Dense Retrieval for Speculative Decoding (DReSD), a novel framework that uses approximate nearest neighbour search with contextualised token embeddings to retrieve the most semantically relevant token sequences for SD. Extensive experiments show that DReSD achieves (on average) 87% higher acceptance rates, 65% longer accepted tokens and 19% faster generation speeds compared to sparse retrieval (REST).</p></details> | Under Review |

Our analysis is based upon a comparison with party responses to 38 statements of the Wahl-O-Mat, a well-established German online tool that helps inform voters by comparing their views with political party positions. For the LLMs, we identify significant biases. They exhibit a strong alignment (over 75% on average) with left-wing parties and a substantially lower alignment with center-right (smaller 50%) and right-wing parties (around 30%). Furthermore, for the VAAs, intended to objectively inform voters, we found substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat: While one VAA deviated in 25% of cases, another VAA showed deviations in more than 50% of cases. For the latter, we even observed that simple prompt injections led to severe hallucinations, including false claims such as non-existent connections between political parties and right-wing extremist ties.</p></details> |  |

Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper and Appendix, 26 pages</p></details> |

This divergent reasoning is also crucial for machines, enhancing their robustness and enabling them to assist humans in many applications such as scientific discovery. However, existing approaches to multi-step reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have mostly focused only on reasoning accuracy, without further discovering more diverse valid solutions. For example, supervised fine-tuning can improve LLM reasoning quality, but requires extensive supervised data to capture the full range of possible solutions. Reward-maximization reinforcement learning aims to find limited highest-reward solutions while neglecting the solution diversity. To fill this gap, we propose Flow of Reasoning (FoR), an efficient diversity-seeking LLM finetuning method aimed at improving reasoning quality and diversity with minimal data. FoR formulates multi-step LLM reasoning as a Markovian flow on a DAG-structured reasoning graph. This formulation allows us to incorporate and adapt principled GFlowNet approaches, for finetuning LLMs to sample divergent paths with probabilities proportional to the (unnormalized) reward of target problems. Extensive experiments show that, with limited training examples (e.g., 15 examples), FoR enables the discovery of diverse, creative, high-quality solutions, greatly outperforming a wide range of existing inference and training methods across six challenging reasoning tasks, including BlocksWorld (embodied reasoning), Game24 (math puzzle solving), Rubik's Cube (spatial reasoning), 1D-ARC (abstraction reasoning), GSM8k (math reasoning), and ProntoQA (logical reasoning).

However, KAG inevitably faces knowledge conflicts when the internal memory contradicts external information. Current approaches to mitigating these conflicts mainly focus on improving external knowledge utilization. However, these methods have shown only limited effectiveness in mitigating the knowledge conflict problem, as internal knowledge continues to influence the generation process of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a ParametrIc Pruning-based Knowledge-Augmented Generation (PIP-KAG) approach, which prunes internal knowledge of LLMs and incorporates a plug-and-play adaptation module to help LLMs better leverage external sources. Additionally, we construct the CoConflictQA benchmark based on the hallucination of LLMs to better evaluate contextual faithfulness during answering questions. Experimental results on CoConflictQA demonstrate that PIP-KAG significantly reduces knowledge conflicts and improves context fidelity. Notably, PIP-KAG reduces LLM's parameters by 13%, enhancing parameter efficiency in LLMs within the KAG framework.

However, compiling trait information for even a moderate number of species is a demanding task that may take experts years to accomplish. At the same time, massive amounts of information about species descriptions is available online in the form of text, although the lack of structure makes this source of data impossible to use at scale. To overcome this, we propose to leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and devise a mechanism for gathering and processing information on plant traits in the form of unstructured textual descriptions, without manual curation. We evaluate our approach by automatically replicating three manually created species-trait matrices. Our method managed to find values for over half of all species-trait pairs, with an F1-score of over 75%. Our results suggest that large-scale creation of structured trait databases from unstructured online text is currently feasible thanks to the information extraction capabilities of LLMs, being limited by the availability of textual descriptions covering all the traits of interest.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we conduct a systematic comparative study on how different retrieval paradigms (sparse vs. dense) and fine-tuning objectives (CL vs. KD vs. their combination) affect retrieval performance across different model scales. Using MSMARCO passages as the training dataset, decoder-only LLMs (Llama-3 series: 1B, 3B, 8B), and a fixed compute budget, we evaluate various training configurations on both in-domain (MSMARCO, TREC DL) and out-of-domain (BEIR) benchmarks. Our key findings reveal that: (1) Scaling behaviors emerge clearly only with CL, where larger models achieve significant performance gains, whereas KD-trained models show minimal improvement, performing similarly across the 1B, 3B, and 8B scales. (2) Sparse retrieval models consistently outperform dense retrieval across both in-domain (MSMARCO, TREC DL) and out-of-domain (BEIR) benchmarks, and they demonstrate greater robustness to imperfect supervised signals. (3) We successfully scale sparse retrieval models with the combination of CL and KD losses at 8B scale, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in all evaluation sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Swift Serverless LLM Cold Starts with ParaServe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15524v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the surge in number of large language models (LLMs), the industry turns to serverless computing for LLM inference serving. However, serverless LLM serving suffers from significant cold start latency and service level objective (SLO) violations due to the substantial model size, which leads to prolonged model fetching time from remote storage. We present ParaServe, a serverless LLM serving system that minimizes cold start latency through the novel use of pipeline parallelism. Our insight is that by distributing model parameters across multiple GPU servers, we can utilize their aggregated network bandwidth to concurrently fetch different parts of the model. ParaServe adopts a two-level hierarchical design. At the cluster level, ParaServe determines the optimal degree of parallelism based on user SLOs and carefully places GPU workers across servers to reduce network interference. At the worker level, ParaServe overlaps model fetching, loading, and runtime initialization to further accelerate cold starts. Additionally, ParaServe introduces pipeline consolidation, which merges parallel groups back to individual workers to maintain optimal performance for warm requests. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that ParaServe reduces the cold start latency by up to 4.7x and improves SLO attainment by up to 1.74x compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Steering in Neural Theorem Provers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15507v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, in highly specialized fields such as cybersecurity, full autonomy remains a challenge. This difficulty primarily stems from the limitations of LLMs in reasoning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge. We propose a system that semi-autonomously executes complex cybersecurity workflows by employing multiple LLMs modules to formulate attack strategies, generate commands, and analyze results, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. In our experiments using Hack The Box virtual machines, we confirmed that our system can autonomously construct attack strategies, issue appropriate commands, and automate certain processes, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 tables and 1 figure</p></details> |

This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can emulate the breadth of human reasoning by predicting both intuitive, fast System 1 and deliberate, slow System 2 processes. We investigate the potential of AI to mimic diverse reasoning behaviors across a human population, addressing what we call the "full reasoning spectrum problem". We designed reasoning tasks using a novel generalization of the Natural Language Inference (NLI) format to evaluate LLMs' ability to replicate human reasoning. The questions were crafted to elicit both System 1 and System 2 responses. Human responses were collected through crowd-sourcing and the entire distribution was modeled, rather than just the majority of the answers. We used personality-based prompting inspired by the Big Five personality model to elicit AI responses reflecting specific personality traits, capturing the diversity of human reasoning, and exploring how personality traits influence LLM outputs. Combined with genetic algorithms to optimize the weighting of these prompts, this method was tested alongside traditional machine learning models. The results show that LLMs can mimic human response distributions, with open-source models like Llama and Mistral outperforming proprietary GPT models. Personality-based prompting, especially when optimized with genetic algorithms, significantly enhanced LLMs' ability to predict human response distributions, suggesting that capturing suboptimal, naturalistic reasoning may require modeling techniques incorporating diverse reasoning styles and psychological profiles. The study concludes that personality-based prompting combined with genetic algorithms is promising for enhancing AI's 'human-ness' in reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Scale-Distribution Decoupling (SDD), a novel approach that stabilizes training by explicitly decoupling the scale and distribution of the weight matrix in fully-connected layers. SDD applies a normalization mechanism to regulate activations and a learnable scaling vector to maintain well-conditioned gradients, effectively preventing $\textbf{gradient explosion and dissipation}$. This separation improves optimization efficiency, particularly in deep networks, by ensuring stable gradient propagation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method stabilizes training across various LLM architectures and outperforms existing techniques in different normalization configurations. Furthermore, the proposed method is lightweight and compatible with existing frameworks, making it a practical solution for stabilizing LLM training.

However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for \emph{non-uniform} model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose \sysname, a method for \emph{training-aware} structured pruning. \sysname builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, \sysname surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring $5\times$ less training data during post-compression training.

This study explores how language-specific tokenizers influence the behavior of Large Language Models predominantly trained with English text data, through the case study of Korean. The research unfolds in two main stages: (1) the development of a Korean-specific extended tokenizer and (2) experiments to compare models with the basic tokenizer and the extended tokenizer through various Next Token Prediction tasks. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the extended tokenizer decreases confidence in incorrect predictions during generation and reduces cross-entropy in complex tasks, indicating a tendency to produce less nonsensical outputs. Consequently, the extended tokenizer provides stability during generation, potentially leading to higher performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite their potential to enhance learning, there is a lack of standardized frameworks to mitigate these risks. Through a systematic literature review, we identify key parental and empirical concerns, including toxicity and ethical breaches in AI outputs. Moreover, to address these issues, this paper proposes a protection framework for safe Child-LLM interaction, incorporating metrics for content safety, behavioral ethics, and cultural sensitivity. The framework provides practical tools for evaluating LLM safety, offering guidance for developers, policymakers, and educators to ensure responsible AI deployment for children.</p></details> |  |

ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events.

For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field. In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of these methods to leverage multimodal data remains underexploited, particularly in complex mechanical systems where relying on a single data source often fails to capture comprehensive fault information. In this paper, we present FaultGPT, a novel model that generates fault diagnosis reports directly from raw vibration signals. By leveraging large vision-language models (LVLM) and text-based supervision, FaultGPT performs end-to-end fault diagnosis question answering (FDQA), distinguishing itself from traditional classification or regression approaches. Specifically, we construct a large-scale FDQA instruction dataset for instruction tuning of LVLM. This dataset includes vibration time-frequency image-text label pairs and human instruction-ground truth pairs. To enhance the capability in generating high-quality fault diagnosis reports, we design a multi-scale cross-modal image decoder to extract fine-grained fault semantics and conducted instruction tuning without introducing additional training parameters into the LVLM. Extensive experiments, including fault diagnosis report generation, few-shot and zero-shot evaluation across multiple datasets, validate the superior performance and adaptability of FaultGPT in diverse industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels. In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\times$ and 11.1$\times$ speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Intuitively, leveraging past events as memory can enrich contextual and temporal understanding of the current event. In this paper, we show that leveraging memories as contexts helps MLLMs better understand video events. However, because such memories rely on predictions of preceding events, they may contain misinformation, leading to confabulation and degraded performance. To address this, we propose a confabulation-aware memory modification method that mitigates confabulated memory for memory-enhanced event understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper (5 pages)</p></details> |

Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), as one of the most popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by approximating the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of down-projection matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and head matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are fine-tuned on data from multiple domains to perform tasks across various fields, embodying multi-task learning (MTL). LoRA often underperforms in such complex scenarios. To enhance LoRA's capability in multi-task learning, we propose R-LoRA, which incorporates Multi-Head Randomization. Multi-Head Randomization diversifies the head matrices through Multi-Head Random Initialization and Multi-Head Dropout, enabling more efficient learning of task-specific features while maintaining shared knowledge representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that R-LoRA is better at capturing task-specific knowledge, thereby improving performance in multi-task scenarios.

CHBench comprises 6,493 entries on mental health and 2,999 entries on physical health, spanning a wide range of topics.

However, the expert load imbalance problem always happens in MoE model pre-training, which will cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. In order to balance loads on experts, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. In simulation experiments, we observe that BIP-Based Balancing make imbalance disappoint very fast, while the final sum of routine scores decreases very little. Our algorithm achieves nearly perfect trade-off between expert load balance and pre-training efficiency under the simulation view.</p></details> |  |

However, the memory requirements of LLMs present a great challenge when deploying on memory-limited devices, even for quantized LLMs. This paper introduces a framework to compress LLM after quantization further, achieving about 2.2x compression ratio. A compression-aware quantization is first proposed to enhance model weight compressibility by re-scaling the model parameters before quantization, followed by a pruning method to improve further. Upon this, we notice that decompression can be a bottleneck during practical scenarios. We then give a detailed analysis of the trade-off between memory usage and latency brought by the proposed method. A speed-adaptive method is proposed to overcome it. The experimental results show inference with the compressed model can achieve a 40% reduction in memory size with negligible loss in accuracy and inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Writing specifications correctly, however, remains particularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using large language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known language Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write complete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English). Two, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with respect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of Alloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy expressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent the desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the experimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show that the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas from input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to enumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at completing given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language descriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases). We believe LLMs offer a very exciting advance in our ability to write specifications, and can help make specifications take a pivotal role in software development and enhance our ability to build robust software.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we focus on detecting jailbreaking input in a single forward pass. Our method, called Single Pass Detection SPD, leverages the information carried by the logits to predict whether the output sentence will be harmful. This allows us to defend in just one forward pass. SPD can not only detect attacks effectively on open-source models, but also minimizes the misclassification of harmless inputs. Furthermore, we show that SPD remains effective even without complete logit access in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We believe that our proposed method offers a promising approach to efficiently safeguard LLMs against adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing model merging methods are often constrained by fixed parameter merging ratios. In this study, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M$^3$), an innovative approach inspired by the Mixup data augmentation technique. This method merges the parameters of two large language models (LLMs) by randomly generating linear interpolation ratios, allowing for a more flexible and comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed M$^3$ method in merging fine-tuned LLMs: (1) it significantly improves performance across multiple tasks, (2) it enhances LLMs' out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness and adversarial robustness, (3) it achieves superior results when combined with sparsification techniques such as DARE, and (4) it offers a simple yet efficient solution that does not require additional computational resources. In conclusion, M$^3$ is a simple yet effective model merging method that significantly enhances the performance of the merged model by randomly generating contribution ratios for two fine-tuned LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MixupModelMerge.</p></details> | 15 pages |

In particular, LLMs can be manipulated into unsafe behaviour by prompts known as jailbreaks. The variety of jailbreak styles is growing, necessitating the use of external defences known as guardrails. While many jailbreak defences have been proposed, not all defences are able to handle new out-of-distribution attacks due to the narrow segment of jailbreaks used to align them. Moreover, the lack of systematisation around defences has created significant gaps in their practical application. In this work, we perform systematic benchmarking across 15 different defences, considering a broad swathe of malicious and benign datasets. We find that there is significant performance variation depending on the style of jailbreak a defence is subject to. Additionally, we show that based on current datasets available for evaluation, simple baselines can display competitive out-of-distribution performance compared to many state-of-the-art defences.

However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</p></details> |  |

Our work presents a novel multiple choice dataset, MHQA (Mental Health Question Answering), for benchmarking Language models (LMs). Previous mental health datasets have focused primarily on text classification into specific labels or disorders. MHQA, on the other hand, presents question-answering for mental health focused on four key domains: anxiety, depression, trauma, and obsessive/compulsive issues, with diverse question types, namely, factoid, diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive. We use PubMed abstracts as the primary source for QA. We develop a rigorous pipeline for LLM-based identification of information from abstracts based on various selection criteria and converting it into QA pairs. Further, valid QA pairs are extracted based on post-hoc validation criteria. Overall, our MHQA dataset consists of 2,475 expert-verified gold standard instances called MHQA-gold and ~56.1k pairs pseudo labeled using external medical references. We report F1 scores on different LLMs along with few-shot and supervised fine-tuning experiments, further discussing the insights for the scores.</p></details> |  |

However, the highly complex and highly granular taxonomy defined by iXBRL limits label transferability across domains. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Financial Key Performance Indicator (HiFi-KPI) dataset, designed to facilitate numerical KPI extraction at specified levels of granularity from unstructured financial text. Our approach organizes a 218,126-label hierarchy using a taxonomy based grouping method, investigating which taxonomy layer provides the most meaningful structure. HiFi-KPI comprises ~1.8M paragraphs and ~5M entities, each linked to a label in the iXBRL-specific calculation and presentation taxonomies. We provide baselines using encoder-based approaches and structured extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs). To simplify LLM inference and evaluation, we additionally release HiFi-KPI Lite, a manually curated subset with four expert-mapped labels. We publicly release all artifacts</p></details> |  |

Previous methods typically relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning. Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available subsequently.</p></details> |  |

However, in machine translation, this sort of feedback can be difficult to solicit. Additionally, Kreutzer et al. (2018) have shown that, for machine translation, pairwise preferences are less reliable than other forms of human feedback, such as 5-point ratings. We examine post-edits to see if they can be a source of reliable human preferences by construction. In PO, a human annotator is shown sequences $s_1$ and $s_2$ and asked for a preference judgment, %$s_1 > s_2$; while for post-editing, editors create $s_1$ and know that it should be better than $s_2$. We attempt to use these implicit preferences for PO and show that it helps the model move towards post-edit-like hypotheses and away from machine translation-like hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that best results are obtained by pre-training the model with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on post-edits in order to promote post-edit-like hypotheses to the top output ranks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the Ninth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT24)</p></details> |

While HCI research focuses on domain-specific applications, little is known about how heavy users integrate LLMs into everyday decision-making. Through qualitative interviews with heavy LLM users (n=7) who employ these systems for both intuitive and analytical thinking tasks, our findings show that participants use LLMs for social validation, self-regulation, and interpersonal guidance, seeking to build self-confidence and optimize cognitive resources. These users viewed LLMs either as rational, consistent entities or average human decision-makers. Our findings suggest that heavy LLM users develop nuanced interaction patterns beyond simple delegation, highlighting the need to reconsider how we study LLM integration in decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce Chitrarth (Chitra: Image; Artha: Meaning), an inclusive Vision-Language Model (VLM), specifically targeting the rich linguistic diversity and visual reasoning across 10 prominent Indian languages. Our model effectively integrates a state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) with a vision module, primarily trained on multilingual image-text data. Furthermore, we also introduce BharatBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating VLMs across various Indian languages, ultimately contributing to more diverse and effective AI systems. Our model achieves SOTA results for benchmarks across low resource languages while retaining its efficiency in English. Through our research, we aim to set new benchmarks in multilingual-multimodal capabilities, offering substantial improvements over existing models and establishing a foundation to facilitate future advancements in this arena.</p></details> |  |

However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

While existing approaches commonly rely on a single pre-trained vision encoder, there is a great variability of specialized encoders that can boost model's performance in distinct domains. In this work, we propose MOVE (Mixture of Vision Encoders) a simple yet effective approach to leverage multiple pre-trained encoders for specialized multimodal tasks. MOVE automatically routes inputs to the most appropriate encoder among candidates such as Unichat, InternViT, and Texify, thereby enhancing performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including ChartQA, MMBench, and MMMU. Experimental results demonstrate that MOVE achieves competitive accuracy without incurring the complexities of image slicing for high-resolution images.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Unlike prior studies that focus solely on answer correctness, we rigorously analyze both final answers and solution steps to identify reasoning failures. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models - including Mixtral, Llama, Gemini, GPT-4o, and OpenAI's o1 variants - we find that while newer models (e.g., o3-mini, deepseek-r1) achieve higher accuracy, all models exhibit errors in spatial reasoning, strategic planning, and arithmetic, sometimes producing correct answers through flawed logic. Common failure modes include unwarranted assumptions, over-reliance on numerical patterns, and difficulty translating physical intuition into mathematical steps. Manual analysis reveals that models struggle with problems requiring multi-step deduction or real-world knowledge, despite possessing broad mathematical knowledge. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating reasoning processes, not just answers, and caution against overestimating LLMs' problem-solving proficiency. The study highlights persistent gaps in LLMs' generalization abilities, emphasizing the need for targeted improvements in structured reasoning and constraint handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptMATH: A Scalable Bidirectional Data Synthesis Framework for Optimization Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11102v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), a fundamental challenge persists: the lack of high-quality optimization modeling datasets hampers LLMs' robust modeling of practical optimization problems from natural language descriptions (NL). This data scarcity also contributes to the generalization difficulties experienced by learning-based methods. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for synthesizing a high-quality dataset, named OptMATH. Starting from curated seed data with mathematical formulations (MF), this framework automatically generates problem data (PD) with controllable complexity. Then, a back-translation step is employed to obtain NL. To verify the correspondence between the NL and the PD, a forward modeling step followed by rejection sampling is used. The accepted pairs constitute the training part of OptMATH. Then a collection of rejected pairs is identified and further filtered. This collection serves as a new benchmark for optimization modeling, containing difficult instances whose lengths are much longer than these of NL4OPT and MAMO. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that models of various sizes (0.5B-32B parameters) trained on OptMATH achieve superior results on multiple modeling benchmarks, thereby validating the effectiveness and scalability of our approach. Our dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/AuroraLHL/OptMATH.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has 36 pages, 18 figures, and two co-first authors: Hongliang Lu and Zhonglin Xie</p></details> |

Although the annotation cost of VidSGG can be alleviated by adopting a weakly supervised approach commonly used for ImgSGG (WS-ImgSGG) that uses image captions, there are two key reasons that hinder such a naive adoption: 1) Temporality within video captions, i.e., unlike image captions, video captions include temporal markers (e.g., before, while, then, after) that indicate time related details, and 2) Variability in action duration, i.e., unlike human actions in image captions, human actions in video captions unfold over varying duration. To address these issues, we propose a Natural Language-based Video Scene Graph Generation (NL-VSGG) framework that only utilizes the readily available video captions for training a VidSGG model. NL-VSGG consists of two key modules: Temporality-aware Caption Segmentation (TCS) module and Action Duration Variability-aware caption-frame alignment (ADV) module. Specifically, TCS segments the video captions into multiple sentences in a temporal order based on a Large Language Model (LLM), and ADV aligns each segmented sentence with appropriate frames considering the variability in action duration. Our approach leads to a significant enhancement in performance compared to simply applying the WS-ImgSGG pipeline to VidSGG on the Action Genome dataset. As a further benefit of utilizing the video captions as weak supervision, we show that the VidSGG model trained by NL-VSGG is able to predict a broader range of action classes that are not included in the training data, which makes our framework practical in reality.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICLR 2025 |

Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning, empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework designed to equip standard LLMs with visual reasoning abilities for maze navigation. First, we leverage Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) on a curated dataset of tokenized maze representations to teach the model to predict step-by-step movement commands. Next, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-a technique used in DeepSeekR1-with a carefully crafted reward function to refine the model's sequential decision-making and encourage emergent chain-of-thought behaviors. Experimental results on synthetically generated mazes show that while a baseline model fails to navigate the maze, the SFT-trained model achieves 86% accuracy, and further GRPO fine-tuning boosts accuracy to 93%. Qualitative analyses reveal that GRPO fosters more robust and self-corrective reasoning, highlighting the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between language models and visual spatial tasks. These findings offer promising implications for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and other domains that require integrated visual and sequential reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Despite the heavy reliance of modern neural IR systems on LMs, little attention has been given to their handling of negation. In this study, we reproduce and extend the findings of NevIR, a benchmark study that revealed most IR models perform at or below the level of random ranking when dealing with negation. We replicate NevIR's original experiments and evaluate newly developed state-of-the-art IR models. Our findings show that a recently emerging category - listwise Large Language Model (LLM) rerankers - outperforms other models but still underperforms human performance. Additionally, we leverage ExcluIR, a benchmark dataset designed for exclusionary queries with extensive negation, to assess the generalizability of negation understanding. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning on one dataset does not reliably improve performance on the other, indicating notable differences in their data distributions. Furthermore, we observe that only cross-encoders and listwise LLM rerankers achieve reasonable performance across both negation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, under review at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

However, when bias is mixed within the reasoning process to form strong logical arguments, it could cause even more harmful results and further induce hallucinations. In this paper, we have evaluated the 8B and 32B variants of DeepSeek-R1 against their instruction tuned counterparts on the BBQ dataset, and investigated the bias that is elicited out and being amplified through reasoning steps. To the best of our knowledge, this empirical study is the first to assess bias issues in LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Although there is increasing interest in automating the design of routing algorithms, existing research has explored only a limited array of VRP variants and fails to adequately address the complex and prevalent constraints encountered in real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RoutBench, a benchmark of 1,000 VRP variants derived from 24 attributes, for evaluating the effectiveness of automatic routing solvers in addressing complex constraints. Along with RoutBench, we present the Automatic Routing Solver (ARS), which employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance a backbone algorithm framework by automatically generating constraint-aware heuristic code, based on problem descriptions and several representative constraints selected from a database. Our experiments show that ARS outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and commonly used solvers, automatically solving 91.67% of common VRPs and achieving at least a 30% improvement across all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

As the landscape of attention variants expands, so too do the challenges of optimizing their performance, particularly across different hardware platforms. Current optimization strategies are often narrowly focused, requiring extensive manual intervention to accommodate changes in model configurations or hardware environments. In this paper, we introduce AttentionEngine, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the optimization of attention mechanisms across heterogeneous hardware backends. By decomposing attention computation into modular operations with customizable components, AttentionEngine enables flexible adaptation to diverse algorithmic requirements. The framework further automates kernel optimization through a combination of programmable templates and a robust cross-platform scheduling strategy. Empirical results reveal performance gains of up to 10x on configurations beyond the reach of existing methods. AttentionEngine offers a scalable, efficient foundation for developing and deploying attention mechanisms with minimal manual tuning. Our code has been open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/microsoft/AttentionEngine.</p></details> | 15 pages |

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the task, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The interpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the researchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific themes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for follow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation of most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity greater than 0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition), indicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of Sample Size, Abstract Degree, and Focus Points on drawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a Magnifier Prompt (MagPrompt), a simple yet effective method to tackle hallucinations in MLLMs via extremely simple instructions. MagPrompt is based on the following two key principles, which guide the design of various effective prompts, demonstrating robustness: (1) MLLMs should focus more on the image. (2) When there are conflicts between the image and the model's inner knowledge, MLLMs should prioritize the image. MagPrompt is training-free and can be applied to open-source and closed-source models, such as GPT-4o and Gemini-pro. It performs well across many datasets and its effectiveness is comparable or even better than more complex methods like VCD.

However, recent studies show that LLMs tend to lose focus over the middle of long contexts. This raises concerns that as reasoning progresses, LLMs may overlook information in earlier steps when decoding subsequent steps, leading to generate unreliable and redundant rationales. To address this, we propose guiding LLMs to generate more accurate and concise step-by-step rationales by (1) proactively referencing information from underutilized prior steps, and (2) minimizing redundant information between new and existing steps. We introduce stepwise informativeness search, an inference-time tree search framework incorporating two selection heuristics: grounding-guided selection which prioritizes steps paying higher attention over underutilized steps; and novelty-guided selection which encourages steps with novel conclusions. During rationale generation, we use a self-grounding strategy that prompts LLMs to explicitly reference relevant prior steps to provide premises before deduction at each step. Experimental results on four reasoning datasets demonstrate that our approach improves reasoning accuracy by generating higher-quality rationales with reduced errors and redundancy.</p></details> | Preprint |

It is important to anticipate the range of potential Jailbreak attacks to guide effective defenses and accurate assessment of model safety. In this paper, we present a new approach for generating highly effective Jailbreak attacks that manipulate the attention of the model to selectively strengthen or weaken attention among different parts of the prompt. By harnessing attention loss, we develop more effective jailbreak attacks, that are also transferrable. The attacks amplify the success rate of existing Jailbreak algorithms including GCG, AutoDAN, and ReNeLLM, while lowering their generation cost (for example, the amplified GCG attack achieves 91.2% ASR, vs. 67.9% for the original attack on Llama2-7B/AdvBench, using less than a third of the generation time).</p></details> |  |

Our key contribution is a novel reasoning-retrieval mechanism that decomposes a complex question into a reasoning chain via systematic prompting and pre-designed actions. Methodologically, we propose three types of domain-adaptable `Plug-and-Play' actions for retrieving real-time information from heterogeneous sources.

Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing fixing techniques predominantly focus on the repair phase, often overlooking the importance of improving the preceding bug localization phase. As a foundational step in issue fixing, bug localization plays a pivotal role in determining the overall effectiveness of the entire process. To enhance the precision of issue fixing by accurately identifying bug locations in large-scale projects, this paper presents BugCerberus, the first hierarchical bug localization framework powered by three customized large language models. First, BugCerberus analyzes intermediate representations of bug-related programs at file, function, and statement levels and extracts bug-related contextual information from the representations. Second, BugCerberus designs three customized LLMs at each level using bug reports and contexts to learn the patterns of bugs. Finally, BugCerberus hierarchically searches for bug-related code elements through well-tuned models to localize bugs at three levels. With BugCerberus, we further investigate the impact of bug localization on the issue fixing. We evaluate BugCerberus on the widely-used benchmark SWE-bench-lite. The experimental results demonstrate that BugCerberus outperforms all baselines. Specifically, at the fine-grained statement level, BugCerberus surpasses the state-of-the-art in Top-N (N=1, 3, 5, 10) by 16.5%, 5.4%, 10.2%, and 23.1%, respectively. Moreover, in the issue fixing experiments, BugCerberus improves the fix rate of the existing issue fixing approach Agentless by 17.4% compared to the best baseline, highlighting the significant impact of enhanced bug localization on automated issue fixing.</p></details> |  |

This process proves effective and reduces the reliance on human supervision in LLMs' reasoning, but the performance soon plateaus. We delve into the process and find that models tend to over-sample on easy queries and under-sample on queries they have yet to master. As iterations proceed, this imbalance in sampling is exacerbated, leading to a long-tail distribution where solutions to difficult queries almost diminish. This phenomenon limits the performance gain of self-improving models. A straightforward solution is brute-force sampling to balance the distribution, which significantly raises computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Guided Self-Improvement (GSI), a strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of sampling challenging heavy-tailed data. It leverages Socratic-style guidance signals to help LLM reasoning with complex queries, reducing the exploration effort and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments on four models across diverse mathematical tasks show that GSI strikes a balance between performance and efficiency, while also being effective on held-out tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Conference.

| **[A Training-free LLM-based Approach to General Chinese Character Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15266v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct character errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Speech Recognition Approach for Domain Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15264v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech recognition systems often face challenges due to domain mismatch, particularly in real-world applications where domain-specific data is unavailable because of data accessibility and confidentiality constraints. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces a LLM-based retrieval-augmented speech recognition method that incorporates domain-specific textual data at the inference stage to enhance recognition performance. Rather than relying on domain-specific textual data during the training phase, our model is trained to learn how to utilize textual information provided in prompts for LLM decoder to improve speech recognition performance. Benefiting from the advantages of the RAG retrieval mechanism, our approach efficiently accesses locally available domain-specific documents, ensuring a convenient and effective process for solving domain mismatch problems. Experiments conducted on the CSJ database demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CSJ dataset, even without relying on the full training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChatVLA: Unified Multimodal Understanding and Robot Control with Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14420v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess a unified cognitive ability to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sub-Ability Diagnosis to Human-Aligned Generation: Bridging the Gap for Text Length Control via MARKERGEN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13544v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their length-controllable text generation (LCTG) ability remains below expectations, posing a major limitation for practical applications. Existing methods mainly focus on end-to-end training to reinforce adherence to length constraints. However, the lack of decomposition and targeted enhancement of LCTG sub-abilities restricts further progress. To bridge this gap, we conduct a bottom-up decomposition of LCTG sub-abilities with human patterns as reference and perform a detailed error analysis. On this basis, we propose MarkerGen, a simple-yet-effective plug-and-play approach that:(1) mitigates LLM fundamental deficiencies via external tool integration;(2) conducts explicit length modeling with dynamically inserted markers;(3) employs a three-stage generation scheme to better align length constraints while maintaining content quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MarkerGen significantly improves LCTG across various settings, exhibiting outstanding effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightMamba: Efficient Mamba Acceleration on FPGA with Quantization and Hardware Co-design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15260v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) like Mamba have recently attracted much attention. Compared to Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), Mamba achieves linear computation complexity with the sequence length and demonstrates superior performance. However, Mamba is hard to accelerate due to the scattered activation outliers and the complex computation dependency, rendering existing LLM accelerators inefficient. In this paper, we propose LightMamba that co-designs the quantization algorithm and FPGA accelerator architecture for efficient Mamba inference. We first propose an FPGA-friendly post-training quantization algorithm that features rotation-assisted quantization and power-of-two SSM quantization to reduce the majority of computation to 4-bit. We further design an FPGA accelerator that partially unrolls the Mamba computation to balance the efficiency and hardware costs. Through computation reordering as well as fine-grained tiling and fusion, the hardware utilization and memory efficiency of the accelerator get drastically improved. We implement LightMamba on Xilinx Versal VCK190 FPGA and achieve 4.65x to 6.06x higher energy efficiency over the GPU baseline. When evaluated on Alveo U280 FPGA, LightMamba reaches 93 tokens/s, which is 1.43x that of the GPU baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DATE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Explanations of Deep Language Models Explain Language Representations in the Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14671v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have given rise to large language models (LLMs) that not only achieve human-like performance but also share computational principles with the brain's language processing mechanisms. While previous research has primarily focused on aligning LLMs' internal representations with neural activity, we introduce a novel approach that leverages explainable AI (XAI) methods to forge deeper connections between the two domains. Using attribution methods, we quantified how preceding words contribute to an LLM's next-word predictions and employed these explanations to predict fMRI recordings from participants listening to the same narratives. Our findings demonstrate that attribution methods robustly predict brain activity across the language network, surpassing traditional internal representations in early language areas. This alignment is hierarchical: early-layer explanations correspond to the initial stages of language processing in the brain, while later layers align with more advanced stages. Moreover, the layers more influential on LLM next-word prediction$\unicode{x2014}$those with higher attribution scores$\unicode{x2014}$exhibited stronger alignment with neural activity. This work establishes a bidirectional bridge between AI and neuroscience. First, we demonstrate that attribution methods offer a powerful lens for investigating the neural mechanisms of language comprehension, revealing how meaning emerges from preceding context. Second, we propose using brain alignment as a metric to evaluate the validity of attribution methods, providing a framework for assessing their biological plausibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[An approach for API synthesis using large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15246v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>APIs play a pivotal role in modern software development by enabling seamless communication and integration between various systems, applications, and services. Component-based API synthesis is a form of program synthesis that constructs an API by assembling predefined components from a library. Existing API synthesis techniques typically implement dedicated search strategies over bounded spaces of possible implementations, which can be very large and time consuming to explore. In this paper, we present a novel approach of using large language models (LLMs) in API synthesis. LLMs offer a foundational technology to capture developer insights and provide an ideal framework for enabling more effective API synthesis. We perform an experimental evaluation of our approach using 135 real-world programming tasks, and compare it with FrAngel, a state-of-the-art API synthesis tool. The experimental results show that our approach completes 133 of the tasks, and overall outperforms FrAngel. We believe LLMs provide a very useful foundation for tackling the problem of API synthesis, in particular, and program synthesis, in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[PiCO: Peer Review in LLMs based on the Consistency Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01830v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on testing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[PersonaMath: Boosting Mathematical Reasoning via Persona-Driven Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01504v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving abilities, open-source models still face challenges with such tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a data augmentation approach and introduce PersonaMathQA, a dataset derived from MATH and GSM8K, on which we train the PersonaMath models. Our approach consists of two stages: the first stage focuses on learning from Persona Diversification, and the second stage emphasizes learning from Reflection. In the first stage, we regenerate detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions as instructions using a closed-source LLM and introduce a persona-driven data augmentation technique. This technique innovatively classifies personas based on occupations, significantly enhancing the dataset's diversity and quality. In the second stage, we incorporate reflection to fully leverage more challenging and valuable questions. Evaluation of our PersonaMath models on MATH and GSM8K reveals that the PersonaMath-7B model (based on Qwen2.5-7B) achieves an accuracy of 61.2% on MATH and 87.8% on GSM8K, surpassing all baseline methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our dataset contains only 128.9K data points-merely 32.6% of MetaMathQA and 49.5% of MathInstruct-yet our model outperforms these baselines, demonstrating the high quality and diversity of our dataset, which enables more efficient model training. We open-source the PersonaMathQA dataset, PersonaMath models, and our code for public usage.</p></details> |  |
