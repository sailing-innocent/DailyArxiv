| **[GuardSplat: Efficient and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19895v5)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently created impressive 3D assets for various applications. However, considering security, capacity, invisibility, and training efficiency, the copyright of 3DGS assets is not well protected as existing watermarking methods are unsuited for its rendering pipeline. In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework for watermarking 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions. Experiments demonstrate that GuardSplat outperforms state-of-the-art and achieves fast optimization speed.

| **[Generative Gaussian Splatting: Generating 3D Scenes with Video Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13272v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing consistent and photorealistic 3D scenes is an open problem in computer vision. Video diffusion models generate impressive videos but cannot directly synthesize 3D representations, i.e., lack 3D consistency in the generated sequences. In addition, directly training generative 3D models is challenging due to a lack of 3D training data at scale. In this work, we present Generative Gaussian Splatting (GGS) -- a novel approach that integrates a 3D representation with a pre-trained latent video diffusion model. Specifically, our model synthesizes a feature field parameterized via 3D Gaussian primitives. The feature field is then either rendered to feature maps and decoded into multi-view images, or directly upsampled into a 3D radiance field. We evaluate our approach on two common benchmark datasets for scene synthesis, RealEstate10K and ScanNet+, and find that our proposed GGS model significantly improves both the 3D consistency of the generated multi-view images, and the quality of the generated 3D scenes over all relevant baselines. Compared to a similar model without 3D representation, GGS improves FID on the generated 3D scenes by ~20% on both RealEstate10K and ScanNet+.

| **[DeGauss: Dynamic-Static Decomposition with Gaussian Splatting for Distractor-free 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13176v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing clean, distractor-free 3D scenes from real-world captures remains a significant challenge, particularly in highly dynamic and cluttered settings such as egocentric videos. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeGauss, a simple and robust self-supervised framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on a decoupled dynamic-static Gaussian Splatting design. DeGauss models dynamic elements with foreground Gaussians and static content with background Gaussians, using a probabilistic mask to coordinate their composition and enable independent yet complementary optimization. DeGauss generalizes robustly across a wide range of real-world scenarios, from casual image collections to long, dynamic egocentric videos, without relying on complex heuristics or extensive supervision. Experiments on benchmarks including NeRF-on-the-go, ADT, AEA, Hot3D, and EPIC-Fields demonstrate that DeGauss consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for generalizable, distractor-free 3D reconstructionin highly dynamic, interaction-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian On-the-Fly Splatting: A Progressive Framework for Robust Near Real-Time 3DGS Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13086v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves high-fidelity rendering with fast real-time performance, but existing methods rely on offline training after full Structure-from-Motion (SfM) processing. In contrast, this work introduces On-the-Fly GS, a progressive framework enabling near real-time 3DGS optimization during image capture. As each image arrives, its pose and sparse points are updated via on-the-fly SfM, and newly optimized Gaussians are immediately integrated into the 3DGS field. We propose a progressive local optimization strategy to prioritize new images and their neighbors by their corresponding overlapping relationship, allowing the new image and its overlapping images to get more training. To further stabilize training across old and new images, an adaptive learning rate schedule balances the iterations and the learning rate. Moreover, to maintain overall quality of the 3DGS field, an efficient global optimization scheme prevents overfitting to the newly added images. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our On-the-Fly GS reduces training time significantly, optimizing each new image in seconds with minimal rendering loss, offering the first practical step toward rapid, progressive 3DGS reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[LAGA: Layered 3D Avatar Generation and Customization via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12663v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating and customizing a 3D clothed avatar from textual descriptions is a critical and challenging task. Traditional methods often treat the human body and clothing as inseparable, limiting users' ability to freely mix and match garments. In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar (LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar, our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level. Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments. Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to various avatars. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach surpasses existing methods in the generation of 3D clothed humans.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoDec-GS: Global-to-Local Motion Decomposition and Temporal Interval Adjustment for Compact Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03714v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant strides in scene representation and neural rendering, with intense efforts focused on adapting it for dynamic scenes. Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The last two authors are co-corresponding authors.

| **[NeuSG: Neural Implicit Surface Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00846v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However, the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-time High-fidelity Radiance Field Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04459v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an efficient radiance field rendering algorithm that incorporates a rasterization process on adaptive sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system. The first is to adaptively and explicitly allocate sparse voxels to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene details with $65536^3$ grid resolution while achieving high rendering frame rates. Second, we customize a rasterizer for efficient adaptive sparse voxels rendering. We render voxels in the correct depth order by using ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, which avoids the well-known popping artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Our method improves the previous neural-free voxel model by over 4db PSNR and more than 10x FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view synthesis results. Additionally, our voxel representation is seamlessly compatible with grid-based 3D processing techniques such as Volume Fusion, Voxel Pooling, and Marching Cubes, enabling a wide range of future extensions and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page at https://svraster.github.io/ ; Code at https://github.com/NVlabs/svraster</p></details> |
| **[CAT-3DGS Pro: A New Benchmark for Efficient 3DGS Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12862v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown immense potential for novel view synthesis. However, achieving rate-distortion-optimized compression of 3DGS representations for transmission and/or storage applications remains a challenge. CAT-3DGS introduces a context-adaptive triplane hyperprior for end-to-end optimized compression, delivering state-of-the-art coding performance. Despite this, it requires prolonged training and decoding time. To address these limitations, we propose CAT-3DGS Pro, an enhanced version of CAT-3DGS that improves both compression performance and computational efficiency. First, we introduce a PCA-guided vector-matrix hyperprior, which replaces the triplane-based hyperprior to reduce redundant parameters. To achieve a more balanced rate-distortion trade-off and faster encoding, we propose an alternate optimization strategy (A-RDO). Additionally, we refine the sampling rate optimization method in CAT-3DGS, leading to significant improvements in rate-distortion performance. These enhancements result in a 46.6% BD-rate reduction and 3x speedup in training time on BungeeNeRF, while achieving 5x acceleration in decoding speed for the Amsterdam scene compared to CAT-3DGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CompMarkGS: Robust Watermarking for Compression 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12836v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rapid differentiable rendering for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, leading to its widespread commercial use. Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.</p></details> | 23 pages, 17 figures |
| **[AV-Surf: Surface-Enhanced Geometry-Aware Novel-View Acoustic Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12806v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling sound propagation with complex real-world environments is essential for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis (NVAS). While previous studies have leveraged visual perception to estimate spatial acoustics, the combined use of surface normal and structural details from 3D representations in acoustic modeling has been underexplored. Given their direct impact on sound wave reflections and propagation, surface normals should be jointly modeled with structural details to achieve accurate spatial acoustics. In this paper, we propose a surface-enhanced geometry-aware approach for NVAS to improve spatial acoustic modeling. To achieve this, we exploit geometric priors, such as image, depth map, surface normals, and point clouds obtained using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based framework. We introduce a dual cross-attention-based transformer integrating geometrical constraints into frequency query to understand the surroundings of the emitter. Additionally, we design a ConvNeXt-based spectral features processing network called Spectral Refinement Network (SRN) to synthesize realistic binaural audio. Experimental results on the RWAVS and SoundSpace datasets highlight the necessity of our approach, as it surpasses existing methods in novel view acoustic synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-Gaussians: Unifying Camera and Lidar Simulation with Gaussians for Dynamic Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08317v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles necessitates comprehensive simulation of multi-sensor data, encompassing inputs from both cameras and LiDAR sensors, across various dynamic driving scenarios. Neural rendering techniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic environments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based approaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera and LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling. Conversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for scene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization. However, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model non-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to sensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified representation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this study proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for rendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data rendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This work presents a unified and efficient solution for realistic simulation of camera and LiDAR data in autonomous driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, offering significant advancements in both rendering quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multi-modal Foundation Models and Video Diffusion for 4D Dynamic Physical Scene Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14423v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic simulation of dynamic scenes requires accurately capturing diverse material properties and modeling complex object interactions grounded in physical principles. However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce PhysFlow, a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08920v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance parameter on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Deblur Gaussian Splatting SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12572v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Deblur-SLAM, a robust RGB SLAM pipeline designed to recover sharp reconstructions from motion-blurred inputs. The proposed method bridges the strengths of both frame-to-frame and frame-to-model approaches to model sub-frame camera trajectories that lead to high-fidelity reconstructions in motion-blurred settings. Moreover, our pipeline incorporates techniques such as online loop closure and global bundle adjustment to achieve a dense and precise global trajectory. We model the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and minimize the error between the observed blurry images and rendered blurry images obtained by averaging sharp virtual sub-frame images. Additionally, by utilizing a monocular depth estimator alongside the online deformation of Gaussians, we ensure precise mapping and enhanced image deblurring. The proposed SLAM pipeline integrates all these components to improve the results. We achieve state-of-the-art results for sharp map estimation and sub-frame trajectory recovery both on synthetic and real-world blurry input data.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTGS: Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12552v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-traversal data, commonly collected through daily commutes or by self-driving fleets, provides multiple viewpoints for scene reconstruction within a road block. This data offers significant potential for high-quality novel view synthesis, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicle simulators. However, inherent challenges in multi-traversal data often result in suboptimal reconstruction quality, including variations in appearance and the presence of dynamic objects. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Traversal Gaussian Splatting (MTGS), a novel approach that reconstructs high-quality driving scenes from arbitrarily collected multi-traversal data by modeling a shared static geometry while separately handling dynamic elements and appearance variations. Our method employs a multi-traversal dynamic scene graph with a shared static node and traversal-specific dynamic nodes, complemented by color correction nodes with learnable spherical harmonics coefficient residuals. This approach enables high-fidelity novel view synthesis and provides flexibility to navigate any viewpoint. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale driving dataset, nuPlan, with multi-traversal data. Our results demonstrate that MTGS improves LPIPS by 23.5% and geometry accuracy by 46.3% compared to single-traversal baselines. The code and data would be available to the public.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPC-GS: Gaussian Splatting with Semantic-Prompt Consistency for Indoor Open-World Free-view Synthesis from Sparse Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12535v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting-based indoor open-world free-view synthesis approaches have shown significant performance with dense input images. However, they exhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to the sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision. To relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based Gaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC) Regularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs. Specifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by utilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and view-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates limited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency constraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from training views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually overlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across Replica and ScanNet benchmarks. Notably, our SPC-GS achieves a 3.06 dB gain in PSNR for reconstruction quality and a 7.3% improvement in mIoU for open-world semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025.

| **[A Hierarchical Compression Technique for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06976v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnitedVLN: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16053v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), where an agent follows instructions to reach a target destination, has recently seen significant advancements. In contrast to navigation in discrete environments with predefined trajectories, VLN in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) presents greater challenges, as the agent is free to navigate any unobstructed location and is more vulnerable to visual occlusions or blind spots. Recent approaches have attempted to address this by imagining future environments, either through predicted future visual images or semantic features, rather than relying solely on current observations. However, these RGB-based and feature-based methods lack intuitive appearance-level information or high-level semantic complexity crucial for effective navigation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel, generalizable 3DGS-based pre-training paradigm, called UnitedVLN, which enables agents to better explore future environments by unitedly rendering high-fidelity 360 visual images and semantic features. UnitedVLN employs two key schemes: search-then-query sampling and separate-then-united rendering, which facilitate efficient exploitation of neural primitives, helping to integrate both appearance and semantic information for more robust navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnitedVLN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing VLN-CE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

As part of our work, we introduce VRSS, the first large-scale paired dataset containing VR sketches, text, images, and 3DGS, bridging the gap in multi-modal VR sketch-based generation. Our approach features the following key innovations: 1) Sketch-CLIP feature alignment. We propose a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the domain gap between sparse VR sketch embeddings and rich CLIP embeddings, facilitating both VR sketch-based retrieval and generation tasks. 2) Fine-Grained multi-modal conditioning. We disentangle the 3D generation process by using explicit VR sketches for geometric conditioning and text descriptions for appearance control. To facilitate this, we propose a generalizable VR sketch encoder that effectively aligns different modalities. 3) Efficient and high-fidelity 3D native generation. Our method leverages a 3D-native generation approach that enables fast and texture-rich 3D object synthesis. Experiments conducted on our VRSS dataset demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality, multi-modal VR sketch-based 3D generation. We believe our VRSS dataset and VRsketch2Gaussian method will be beneficial for the 3D generation community.</p></details> |  |

Traditional mesh-based approaches require tedious and error-prone mesh filling and fixing process, while typically output rough boundary surface. Our pipeline combines Gaussian Splatting with a novel, versatile particle-based differentiable simulator that simultaneously accommodates constitutive model, actuator, and collision, without interference with mesh. Based on the gradients from this simulator, we provide flexible choice of topology representation for optimization, including particle, neural implicit surface, and quadratic surface. The resultant pipeline takes easily accessible photos and videos as input and outputs the topology that matches the physical characteristics of the input. We demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline on a synthetic dataset and four real-world tasks with 3D-printed prototypes. Compared with existing mesh-based method, our pipeline is 5.26x faster on average with improved shape quality. These results highlight the potential of our pipeline in 3D vision, soft robotics, and manufacturing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS-3I: Gaussian Splatting for Surface Reconstruction from Illumination-Inconsistent Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12335v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate geometric surface reconstruction, providing essential environmental information for navigation and manipulation tasks, is critical for enabling robotic self-exploration and interaction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in the field of surface reconstruction due to its impressive geometric quality and computational efficiency. While recent relevant advancements in novel view synthesis under inconsistent illumination using 3DGS have shown promise, the challenge of robust surface reconstruction under such conditions is still being explored. To address this challenge, we propose a method called GS-3I. Specifically, to mitigate 3D Gaussian optimization bias caused by underexposed regions in single-view images, based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a tone mapping correction framework is introduced. Furthermore, inconsistent lighting across multi-view images, resulting from variations in camera settings and complex scene illumination, often leads to geometric constraint mismatches and deviations in the reconstructed surface. To overcome this, we propose a normal compensation mechanism that integrates reference normals extracted from single-view image with normals computed from multi-view observations to effectively constrain geometric inconsistencies. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that GS-3I can achieve robust and accurate surface reconstruction across complex illumination scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in this critical challenge. https://github.com/TFwang-9527/GS-3I</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Swift4D:Adaptive divide-and-conquer Gaussian Splatting for compact and efficient reconstruction of dynamic scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12307v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis has long been a practical but challenging task, although the introduction of numerous methods to solve this problem, even combining advanced representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, they still struggle to recover high-quality results and often consume too much storage memory and training time. In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets.

| **[REdiSplats: Ray Tracing for Editable Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12284v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has become one of the most important neural rendering algorithms. GS represents 3D scenes using Gaussian components with trainable color and opacity. This representation achieves high-quality renderings with fast inference. Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution with varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual adjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared that incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of these caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the existing limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce REdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat 3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions parameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control Gaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats allows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical simulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as Blender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all existing 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.</p></details> |  |

As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel Real2Sim methodology, Instrument-Splatting, that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to provide fully controllable 3D reconstruction of surgical instruments from monocular surgical videos. To maintain both high visual fidelity and manipulability, we introduce a geometry pre-training to bind Gaussian point clouds on part mesh with accurate geometric priors and define a forward kinematics to control the Gaussians as flexible as real instruments. Afterward, to handle unposed videos, we design a novel instrument pose tracking method leveraging semantics-embedded Gaussians to robustly refine per-frame instrument poses and joint states in a render-and-compare manner, which allows our instrument Gaussian to accurately learn textures and reach photorealistic rendering. We validated our method on 2 publicly released surgical videos and 4 videos collected on ex vivo tissues and green screens. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods relying on dense point clouds and triangular meshes struggle with moving objects, occlusions, and real-time processing constraints, limiting their effectiveness in complex urban environments. While multi-view stereo and neural radiance fields have advanced 3D reconstruction, they face challenges in computational efficiency and handling scene dynamics. This paper proposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene reconstruction. Our approach introduces an adaptive transparency mechanism that eliminates moving objects while preserving high-fidelity static scene details. Additionally, iterative refinement of Gaussian point distribution enhances geometric accuracy and texture representation. We integrate directional encoding with spatial position optimization to optimize storage and rendering efficiency, reducing redundancy while maintaining scene integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high reconstruction quality, improved rendering performance, and adaptability in large-scale dynamic environments. These contributions establish a robust framework for real-time, high-precision 3D reconstruction, advancing the practicality of dynamic scene modeling across multiple applications.

However, most existing techniques struggle with compositional prompts, which describe multiple objects and their spatial relationships. They often fail to capture fine-grained inter-object interactions. We introduce DecompDreamer, a Gaussian splatting-based training routine designed to generate high-quality 3D compositions from such complex prompts. DecompDreamer leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to decompose scenes into structured components and their relationships. We propose a progressive optimization strategy that first prioritizes joint relationship modeling before gradually shifting toward targeted object refinement. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art text-to-3D models demonstrate that DecompDreamer effectively generates intricate 3D compositions with superior object disentanglement, offering enhanced control and flexibility in 3D generation.

Hence, high quality and fast mapping becomes a fundamental problem. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed, state-of-the-art (SOTA) works introduce GS to SLAM. Compared to classical pointcloud-SLAM, GS-SLAM generates photometric information by learning from input camera views and synthesize unseen views with high-quality textures. However, these GS-SLAM fail when moving objects occupy the scene that violate the static assumption of bundle adjustment. The failed updates of moving GS affects the static GS and contaminates the full map over long frames. Although some efforts have been made by concurrent works to consider moving objects for GS-SLAM, they simply detect and remove the moving regions from GS rendering ("anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM), where only the static background could benefit from GS. To this end, we propose the first real-time GS-SLAM, "DynaGSLAM'', that achieves high-quality online GS rendering, tracking, motion predictions of moving objects in dynamic scenes while jointly estimating accurate ego motion. Our DynaGSLAM outperforms SOTA static & "Anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM on three dynamic real datasets, while keeping speed and memory efficiency in practice.</p></details> |  |

Existing editing approaches face two critical challenges: inconsistent geometric reconstructions across multiple viewpoints, particularly in challenging camera positions, and ineffective utilization of depth information during image manipulation, resulting in over-texture artifacts and degraded object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce: 1) A complementary information mutual learning network that enhances depth map estimation from 3DGS, enabling precise depth-conditioned 3D editing while preserving geometric structures. 2) A wavelet consensus attention mechanism that effectively aligns latent codes during the diffusion denoising process, ensuring multi-view consistency in the edited results. Through extensive experimentation, our method demonstrates superior performance in rendering quality and view consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results validate our framework as an effective solution for text-guided editing of 3D scenes.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

Occlusions and varied viewpoints can lead to multi-view semantic inconsistencies, while dynamic objects may act as transient distractors, introducing artifacts into semantic feature modeling. To address these challenges, we propose EgoSplat, a language-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding. A multi-view consistent instance feature aggregation method is designed to leverage the segmentation and tracking capabilities of SAM2 to selectively aggregate complementary features across views for each instance, ensuring precise semantic representation of scenes. Additionally, an instance-aware spatial-temporal transient prediction module is constructed to improve spatial integrity and temporal continuity in predictions by incorporating spatial-temporal associations across multi-view instances, effectively reducing artifacts in the semantic reconstruction of egocentric scenes. EgoSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in both localization and segmentation tasks on two datasets, outperforming existing methods with a 8.2% improvement in localization accuracy and a 3.7% improvement in segmentation mIoU on the ADT dataset, and setting a new benchmark in open-vocabulary egocentric scene understanding.

| **[GauSTAR: Gaussian Surface Tracking and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10283v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting techniques have enabled efficient photo-realistic rendering of static scenes. Recent works have extended these approaches to support surface reconstruction and tracking. However, tracking dynamic surfaces with 3D Gaussians remains challenging due to complex topology changes, such as surfaces appearing, disappearing, or splitting. To address these challenges, we propose GauSTAR, a novel method that achieves photo-realistic rendering, accurate surface reconstruction, and reliable 3D tracking for general dynamic scenes with changing topology. Given multi-view captures as input, GauSTAR binds Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects. For surfaces with consistent topology, GauSTAR maintains the mesh topology and tracks the meshes using Gaussians. For regions where topology changes, GauSTAR adaptively unbinds Gaussians from the mesh, enabling accurate registration and generation of new surfaces based on these optimized Gaussians. Additionally, we introduce a surface-based scene flow method that provides robust initialization for tracking between frames. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively tracks and reconstructs dynamic surfaces, enabling a range of applications. Our project page with the code release is available at https://eth-ait.github.io/GauSTAR/.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based system to address these challenges: We first break down sensor simulator components and analyze the possible advantages of GS over NeRF. Then in practice, we refactor three crucial components through GS, to leverage its explicit scene representation and real-time rendering: (1) choosing the 2D neural Gaussian representation for physics-compliant scene and sensor modeling, (2) proposing a scene editing pipeline to leverage Gaussian primitives library for data augmentation, and (3) coupling a controllable diffusion model for scene expansion and harmonization. We implement this framework on a proprietary autonomous driving dataset supporting cameras and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate through ablation studies that our approach reduces frame-wise simulation latency, achieves better geometric and photometric consistency, and enables interpretable explicit scene editing and expansion. Furthermore, we showcase how integrating such a GS-based sensor simulator with traffic and dynamic simulators enables full-stack testing of end-to-end autonomy algorithms. Our work provides both algorithmic insights and practical validation, establishing GS as a cornerstone for industrial-grade sensor simulation.</p></details> |  |

Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF.

However, its efficacy diminishes considerably in sparse image sequences, where inherent data sparsity amplifies geometric uncertainty during optimization. This often leads to convergence at suboptimal local minima, resulting in noticeable structural artifacts in the reconstructed scenes.To mitigate these issues, we propose Uncertainty-aware Normal-Guided Gaussian Splatting (UNG-GS), a novel framework featuring an explicit Spatial Uncertainty Field (SUF) to quantify geometric uncertainty within the 3DGS pipeline. UNG-GS enables high-fidelity rendering and achieves high-precision reconstruction without relying on priors. Specifically, we first integrate Gaussian-based probabilistic modeling into the training of 3DGS to optimize the SUF, providing the model with adaptive error tolerance. An uncertainty-aware depth rendering strategy is then employed to weight depth contributions based on the SUF, effectively reducing noise while preserving fine details. Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided normal refinement method adjusts the influence of neighboring depth values in normal estimation, promoting robust results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNG-GS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sparse and dense sequences. The code will be open-source.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Our key contribution is separating the view synthesis process into two tasks of reconstructing visible regions and hallucinating missing regions, and introducing two personalized diffusion models, each tailored to one of these tasks. Specifically, one model ('repair') takes a rendered image as input and predicts the corresponding high-quality image, which in turn is used as a pseudo ground truth image to constrain the optimization. The other model ('inpainting') primarily focuses on hallucinating details in unobserved areas. To integrate these models effectively, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy: the first stage reconstructs visible areas using the repair model, and the second stage reconstructs missing regions with the inpainting model while ensuring coherence through further optimization. Moreover, we augment the optimization with a novel Gaussian initialization method that obtains per-image depth by combining 3D-consistent and smooth depth with highly detailed relative depth. We demonstrate that by separating the process into two tasks and addressing them with the repair and inpainting models, we produce results with detailed textures in both visible and missing regions that outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a diverse set of scenes with extremely sparse inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/Papers/RI3D, Code: https://github.com/avinashpaliwal/RI3D</p></details> |

To overcome this, we propose the Avatar Concept Slider (ACS), a 3D avatar editing method that allows precise editing of semantic concepts in human avatars towards a specified intermediate point between two extremes of concepts, akin to moving a knob along a slider track. To achieve this, our ACS has three designs: Firstly, a Concept Sliding Loss based on linear discriminant analysis to pinpoint the concept-specific axes for precise editing. Secondly, an Attribute Preserving Loss based on principal component analysis for improved preservation of avatar identity during editing. We further propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting primitive selection mechanism based on concept-sensitivity, which updates only the primitives that are the most sensitive to our target concept, to improve efficiency. Results demonstrate that our ACS enables controllable 3D avatar editing, without compromising the avatar quality or its identifying attributes.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lingtengqiu.github.io/LHM/</p></details> |

Nevertheless, critical limitations persist: reconstruction-based methods exhibit substantial performance deterioration under significant viewpoint deviations from training trajectories, while generation-based techniques struggle with temporal coherence and precise scene controllability. To overcome these challenges, we present MuDG, an innovative framework that integrates Multi-modal Diffusion model with Gaussian Splatting (GS) for Urban Scene Reconstruction. MuDG leverages aggregated LiDAR point clouds with RGB and geometric priors to condition a multi-modal video diffusion model, synthesizing photorealistic RGB, depth, and semantic outputs for novel viewpoints. This synthesis pipeline enables feed-forward NVS without computationally intensive per-scene optimization, providing comprehensive supervision signals to refine 3DGS representations for rendering robustness enhancement under extreme viewpoint changes. Experiments on the Open Waymo Dataset demonstrate that MuDG outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction and synthesis quality.</p></details> |  |

However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

The core of our method lies in a novel transformer-based network architecture. In particular, our model starts with an image encoder that maps each image to a list of visual tokens. All visual tokens are concatenated with additional inserted learnable camera tokens. The obtained tokens then fully communicate with each other within a tailored transformer decoder. The camera tokens causally aggregate features from visual tokens of different views, and further modulate them frame-wisely to inject view-dependent features. 3D Gaussian splats and camera pose parameters can then be estimated via different prediction heads. Experiments show that VicaSplat surpasses baseline methods for multi-view inputs, and achieves comparable performance to prior two-view approaches. Remarkably, VicaSplat also demonstrates exceptional cross-dataset generalization capability on the ScanNet benchmark, achieving superior performance without any fine-tuning.

Isolating individual 3D Gaussian primitives for each object and handling occlusions in scenes remain far from being solved. We propose a novel object extraction method based on two key principles: (1) being object-centric by pruning irrelevant primitives; and (2) leveraging generative inpainting to compensate for missing observations caused by occlusions. For pruning, we analyze the local structure of primitives using K-nearest neighbors, and retain only relevant ones. For inpainting, we employ an off-the-shelf diffusion-based inpainter combined with occlusion reasoning, utilizing the 3D representation of the entire scene. Our findings highlight the crucial synergy between pruning and inpainting, both of which significantly enhance extraction performance. We evaluate our method on a standard real-world dataset and introduce a synthetic dataset for quantitative analysis. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness in object extraction from complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yeonjin-chang.github.io/ROODI/</p></details> |

However, achieving high-granularity surface reconstruction and high-fidelity rendering remains a challenge. Gaussian splatting offers efficient photorealistic rendering but struggles with geometric inconsistencies due to fragmented primitives and sparse observational data in robotics applications. Existing regularization methods, which rely on render-derived constraints, often fail in complex environments. Moreover, effectively integrating sparse LiDAR data with Gaussian splatting remains challenging. We propose a unified LiDAR-visual system that synergizes Gaussian splatting with a neural signed distance field. The accurate LiDAR point clouds enable a trained neural signed distance field to offer a manifold geometry field, This motivates us to offer an SDF-based Gaussian initialization for physically grounded primitive placement and a comprehensive geometric regularization for geometrically consistent rendering and reconstruction.

Current training paradigms with 3D tone mapping often result in unstable HDR reconstruction, while training with 2D tone mapping reduces the model's capacity to fit LDR images. Additionally, the global tone mapper used in existing methods can impede the learning of both HDR and LDR representations. To address these challenges, we present GaussHDR, which unifies 3D and 2D local tone mapping through 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we design a residual local tone mapper for both 3D and 2D tone mapping that accepts an additional context feature as input. We then propose combining the dual LDR rendering results from both 3D and 2D local tone mapping at the loss level. Finally, recognizing that different scenes may exhibit varying balances between the dual results, we introduce uncertainty learning and use the uncertainties for adaptive modulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussHDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, 3D-GS and its variants assume that input images are captured based on pinhole imaging and are fully in focus. This assumption limits their applicability, as real-world images often feature shallow depth-of-field (DoF). In this paper, we introduce DoF-Gaussian, a controllable depth-of-field method for 3D-GS. We develop a lens-based imaging model based on geometric optics principles to control DoF effects. To ensure accurate scene geometry, we incorporate depth priors adjusted per scene, and we apply defocus-to-focus adaptation to minimize the gap in the circle of confusion. We also introduce a synthetic dataset to assess refocusing capabilities and the model's ability to learn precise lens parameters. Our framework is customizable and supports various interactive applications. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05256v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis (NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast, extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art NVS methods across different evaluation settings. Our results show that current NVS methods are prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and large-scale training. We will release the data to help advance self-driving and urban robotics simulation technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ai4ce.github.io/EUVS-Benchmark/</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Language Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09447v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08017v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) advancing real-time and high-fidelity rendering for novel view synthesis, storage requirements pose challenges for their widespread adoption. Although various compression techniques have been proposed, previous art suffers from a common limitation: for any existing 3DGS, per-scene optimization is needed to achieve compression, making the compression sluggish and slow. To address this issue, we introduce Fast Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting (FCGS), an optimization-free model that can compress 3DGS representations rapidly in a single feed-forward pass, which significantly reduces compression time from minutes to seconds. To enhance compression efficiency, we propose a multi-path entropy module that assigns Gaussian attributes to different entropy constraint paths for balance between size and fidelity. We also carefully design both inter- and intra-Gaussian context models to remove redundancies among the unstructured Gaussian blobs. Overall, FCGS achieves a compression ratio of over 20X while maintaining fidelity, surpassing most per-scene SOTA optimization-based methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YihangChen-ee/FCGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yihangchen-ee.github.io/project_fcgs/ Code: https://github.com/yihangchen-ee/fcgs/</p></details> |
| **[Close-up-GS: Enhancing Close-Up View Synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09396v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[GASPACHO: Gaussian Splatting for Controllable Humans and Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09342v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GASPACHO: a method for generating photorealistic controllable renderings of human-object interactions. Given a set of multi-view RGB images of human-object interactions, our method reconstructs animatable templates of the human and object as separate sets of Gaussians simultaneously. Different from existing work, which focuses on human reconstruction and ignores objects as background, our method explicitly reconstructs both humans and objects, thereby allowing for controllable renderings of novel human object interactions in different poses from novel-camera viewpoints. During reconstruction, we constrain the Gaussians that generate rendered images to be a linear function of a set of canonical Gaussians. By simply changing the parameters of the linear deformation functions after training, our method can generate renderings of novel human-object interaction in novel poses from novel camera viewpoints. We learn the 3D Gaussian properties of the canonical Gaussians on the underlying 2D manifold of the canonical human and object templates. This in turns requires a canonical object template with a fixed UV unwrapping. To define such an object template, we use a feature based representation to track the object across the multi-view sequence. We further propose an occlusion aware photometric loss that allows for reconstructions under significant occlusions. Several experiments on two human-object datasets - BEHAVE and DNA-Rendering - demonstrate that our method allows for high-quality reconstruction of human and object templates under significant occlusion and the synthesis of controllable renderings of novel human-object interactions in novel human poses from novel camera views.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDD-4DGS: Static-Dynamic Aware Decoupling in Gaussian Splatting for 4D Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09332v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic and static components in scenes often exhibit distinct properties, yet most 4D reconstruction methods treat them indiscriminately, leading to suboptimal performance in both cases. This work introduces SDD-4DGS, the first framework for static-dynamic decoupled 4D scene reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting. Our approach is built upon a novel probabilistic dynamic perception coefficient that is naturally integrated into the Gaussian reconstruction pipeline, enabling adaptive separation of static and dynamic components. With carefully designed implementation strategies to realize this theoretical framework, our method effectively facilitates explicit learning of motion patterns for dynamic elements while maintaining geometric stability for static structures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDD-4DGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction fidelity, with enhanced detail restoration for static structures and precise modeling of dynamic motions. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVA-Gaussian: 3D Gaussian-based Real-time Human Novel View Synthesis under Diverse Multi-view Camera Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01425v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have demonstrated exceptional capability in real-time novel view synthesis for human models. However, current approaches are confined to either dense viewpoint configurations or restricted image resolutions. These limitations hinder their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies, and also restrict their ability to recover fine-grained human details in real time using commonly available GPUs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse multi-view camera settings. Specifically, we first design an Efficient Cross-View Attention (EVA) module to effectively fuse cross-view information under high resolution inputs and sparse view settings, while minimizing temporal and computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a feature refinement mechianism to predict the attributes of the 3D Gaussians and assign a feature value to each Gaussian, enabling the correction of artifacts caused by geometric inaccuracies in position estimation and enhancing overall visual fidelity. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of EVA-Gaussian in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

| **[Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06838v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locality-aware Gaussian Compression for Fast and High-quality Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05757v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LocoGS, a locality-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that exploits the spatial coherence of 3D Gaussians for compact modeling of volumetric scenes. To this end, we first analyze the local coherence of 3D Gaussian attributes, and propose a novel locality-aware 3D Gaussian representation that effectively encodes locally-coherent Gaussian attributes using a neural field representation with a minimal storage requirement. On top of the novel representation, LocoGS is carefully designed with additional components such as dense initialization, an adaptive spherical harmonics bandwidth scheme and different encoding schemes for different Gaussian attributes to maximize compression performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the rendering quality of existing compact Gaussian representations for representative real-world 3D datasets while achieving from 54.6$\times$ to 96.6$\times$ compressed storage size and from 2.1$\times$ to 2.4$\times$ rendering speed than 3DGS. Even our approach also demonstrates an averaged 2.4$\times$ higher rendering speed than the state-of-the-art compression method with comparable compression performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[DynOMo: Online Point Tracking by Dynamic Online Monocular Gaussian Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02104v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing scenes and tracking motion are two sides of the same coin. Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [24, 39]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted to 3DV 2025 |
| **[TrackGS: Optimizing COLMAP-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting with Global Track Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19800v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced ability on novel view synthesis, it still depends on accurate pre-computaed camera parameters, which are hard to obtain and prone to noise. Previous COLMAP-Free methods optimize camera poses using local constraints, but they often struggle in complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce TrackGS, which incorporates feature tracks to globally constrain multi-view geometry. We select the Gaussians associated with each track, which will be trained and rescaled to an infinitesimally small size to guarantee the spatial accuracy. We also propose minimizing both reprojection and backprojection errors for better geometric consistency. Moreover, by deriving the gradient of intrinsics, we unify camera parameter estimation with 3DGS training into a joint optimization framework, achieving SOTA performance on challenging datasets with severe camera movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[EigenGS Representation: From Eigenspace to Gaussian Image Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07446v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, and 2D Gaussian representation, an adaptation of 3D Gaussian Splatting for image representation, offer distinct approaches to modeling visual data. We present EigenGS, a novel method that bridges these paradigms through an efficient transformation pipeline connecting eigenspace and image-space Gaussian representations. Our approach enables instant initialization of Gaussian parameters for new images without requiring per-image optimization from scratch, dramatically accelerating convergence. EigenGS introduces a frequency-aware learning mechanism that encourages Gaussians to adapt to different scales, effectively modeling varied spatial frequencies and preventing artifacts in high-resolution reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EigenGS not only achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to direct 2D Gaussian fitting but also reduces necessary parameter count and training time. The results highlight EigenGS's effectiveness and generalization ability across images with varying resolutions and diverse categories, making Gaussian-based image representation both high-quality and viable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Aware Human-Object Rendering from Sparse Views via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09640v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering realistic human-object interactions (HOIs) from sparse-view inputs is challenging due to occlusions and incomplete observations, yet crucial for various real-world applications. Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09040v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MB-GS), a novel framework that uses motion graph as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of graph links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions determining the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MB-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. Additionally, we demonstrate the application potential of our method in generating novel object motions and robot demonstrations through motion editing. Video demonstrations can be found at https://mlzxy.github.io/mbgs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00144v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in novel view synthesis (NVS). However, 3DGS tends to overfit when trained with sparse views, limiting its generalization to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we address this overfitting issue by introducing Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS). We achieve self-ensembling by incorporating an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy during training. A $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model and a $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model are jointly trained on the available images. The $\mathbf{\Delta}$-model is dynamically perturbed based on rendering uncertainty across training steps, generating diverse perturbed models with negligible computational overhead. Discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and these perturbed models are minimized throughout training, forming a robust ensemble of 3DGS models. This ensemble, represented by the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model, is then used to generate novel-view images during inference. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances NVS quality under few-shot training conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at: https://sailor-z.github.io/projects/SEGS.html.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Your Hands: Lightweight Relightable Turntable Capture Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05511v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating and tedious manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we present a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup. We use a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. As the turntable rotates, we automatically capture dense samples from various views and lighting conditions; we can repeat this for several camera positions. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary; this is harmful to a standard NVS method like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) which assumes fixed lighting. We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows relightability as an additional benefit. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving competitive quality compared to previous methods with exhaustive acquisition and showcasing its potential for relighting and harmonization tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose AutoOcc, an vision-centric automated pipeline for open-ended semantic occupancy annotation that integrates differentiable Gaussian splatting guided by vision-language models. We formulate the open-ended semantic occupancy reconstruction task to automatically generate scene occupancy by combining attention maps from vision-language models and foundation vision models. We devise semantic-aware Gaussians as intermediate geometric descriptors and propose a cumulative Gaussian-to-voxel splatting algorithm that enables effective and efficient occupancy annotation. Our framework outperforms existing automated occupancy annotation methods without human labels. AutoOcc also enables open-ended semantic occupancy auto-labeling, achieving robust performance in both static and dynamically complex scenarios. All the source codes and trained models will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving both high-fidelity textured surface reconstruction and dynamic generation for articulated objects remains challenging for existing methods. In this paper, we present REArtGS, a novel framework that introduces additional geometric and motion constraints to 3D Gaussian primitives, enabling high-quality textured surface reconstruction and generation for articulated objects. Specifically, given multi-view RGB images of arbitrary two states of articulated objects, we first introduce an unbiased Signed Distance Field (SDF) guidance to regularize Gaussian opacity fields, enhancing geometry constraints and improving surface reconstruction quality. Then we establish deformable fields for 3D Gaussians constrained by the kinematic structures of articulated objects, achieving unsupervised generation of surface meshes in unseen states. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate our approach achieves high-quality textured surface reconstruction for given states, and enables high-fidelity surface generation for unseen states. Codes will be released within the next four months and the project website is at https://sites.google.com/view/reartgs/home.</p></details> | 11pages, 6 figures |

We take a bottom-up approach in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation. Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting. Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train, achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods. Further, FAST-Splat achieves relatively similar or better semantic segmentation performance compared to existing methods. After the review period, we will provide links to the project website and the codebase.</p></details> |  |

Commonly used publicly-available AD datasets typically contain large amounts of car and vehicle object instances but a low number of cyclist instances, usually with limited appearance and pose diversity. This cyclist training data scarcity problem not only limits the generalization of deep-learning perception models for cyclist semantic segmentation, pose estimation, and cyclist crossing intention prediction, but also limits research on new cyclist-related tasks such as fine-grained cyclist pose estimation and spatio-temporal analysis under complex interactions between humans and articulated objects. To address this data scarcity problem, in this paper we propose a framework to generate synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist data assets that can be used to generate training data for different tasks. In our framework, we designed a methodology for creating a new part-based multi-view articulated synthetic 3D bicycle dataset that we call 3DArticBikes that we use to train a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based reconstruction and image rendering method. We then propose a parametric bicycle 3DGS composition model to assemble 8-DoF pose-controllable 3D bicycles. Finally, using dynamic information from cyclist videos, we build a complete synthetic dynamic 3D cyclist (rider pedaling a bicycle) by re-posing a selectable synthetic 3D person, while automatically placing the rider onto one of our new articulated 3D bicycles using a proposed 3D Keypoint optimization-based Inverse Kinematics pose refinement. We present both, qualitative and quantitative results where we compare our generated cyclists against those from a recent stable diffusion-based method.</p></details> |  |

FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space.

Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance supervision for unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue high-fidelity geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for practical applications. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently utilize existing bitstreams in on-demand applications due to their lack of progressivity, leading to a waste of resource. To address this issue, we propose PCGS (Progressive Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting), which adaptively controls both the quantity and quality of Gaussians (or anchors) to enable effective progressivity for on-demand applications. Specifically, for quantity, we introduce a progressive masking strategy that incrementally incorporates new anchors while refining existing ones to enhance fidelity. For quality, we propose a progressive quantization approach that gradually reduces quantization step sizes to achieve finer modeling of Gaussian attributes. Furthermore, to compact the incremental bitstreams, we leverage existing quantization results to refine probability prediction, improving entropy coding efficiency across progressive levels. Overall, PCGS achieves progressivity while maintaining compression performance comparable to SoTA non-progressive methods.

| **[TT-GaussOcc: Test-Time Compute for Self-Supervised Occupancy Prediction via Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08485v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised 3D occupancy prediction offers a promising solution for understanding complex driving scenes without requiring costly 3D annotations. However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Floating orbitals are a long-standing idea in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding ideal placements of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussians as our orbitals and predict their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, the limited information from single-view input, combined with the complex head poses and facial movements, makes this challenging. Previous methods achieve real-time performance by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a parametric head model, but the resulting head quality suffers from inaccurate face tracking and limited expressiveness of the deformation model. These methods also fail to produce realistic effects under novel lighting conditions. To address these issues, we propose HRAvatar, a 3DGS-based method that reconstructs high-fidelity, relightable 3D head avatars. HRAvatar reduces tracking errors through end-to-end optimization and better captures individual facial deformations using learnable blendshapes and learnable linear blend skinning. Additionally, it decomposes head appearance into several physical properties and incorporates physically-based shading to account for environmental lighting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRAvatar not only reconstructs superior-quality heads but also achieves realistic visual effects under varying lighting conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://eastbeanzhang.github.io/HRAvatar</p></details> |

However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods suffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size increases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the conventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue: unnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections, and inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we propose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale Street Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations. Moreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding boxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are difficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or can be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs together make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and significantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos from the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing methods.</p></details> |  |

With two distinct sets of multi-view imagery, each depicting an object in separate static articulation configurations, we reconstruct the articulated object in 3D Gaussian representations with both appearance and geometry information at the same time. Our approach decoupled multiple highly interdependent parameters through a multi-step optimization process, thereby achieving a stable optimization procedure and high-quality outcomes. We introduce ArticulatedGS, a self-supervised, comprehensive framework that autonomously learns to model shapes and appearances at the part level and synchronizes the optimization of motion parameters, all without reliance on 3D supervision, motion cues, or semantic labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that, among comparable methodologies, our approach has achieved optimal outcomes in terms of part segmentation accuracy, motion estimation accuracy, and visual quality.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-aggregative constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high-quality, multi-view consistent 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, but also significantly improves training and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://w-ted.github.io/publications/F3D-Gaus</p></details> |

However, the clone and split operations within ADC are not sufficiently efficient, impacting optimization speed and detail recovery. Additionally, overfitted Gaussians that affect rendering quality may exist, and the original ADC is unable to remove them. To address these issues, we propose two key innovations: (1) Long-Axis Split, which precisely controls the position, shape, and opacity of child Gaussians to minimize the difference before and after splitting. (2) Recovery-Aware Pruning, which leverages differences in recovery speed after resetting opacity to prune overfitted Gaussians, thereby improving generalization performance. Experimental results show that our method significantly enhances rendering quality. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoBin2001/EDC.</p></details> |  |

Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations, including the necessity for manual annotations, rigid skeleton topologies, and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach is to generate animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However, this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues, we present Make-It-Animatable, a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shapes and poses. Our unified framework generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations. By incorporating a particle-based shape autoencoder, our approach supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. Additionally, we employ a coarse-to-fine representation and a structure-aware modeling strategy to ensure both accuracy and robustness, even for characters with non-standard skeleton structures. We conducted extensive experiments to validate our framework's effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quality and speed.

Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first NeRF/3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI and KITTI 360 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

Widely adopted approaches supervise complex interactions with additional masks and control signal annotations, limiting their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose an annotation guidance-free method, dubbed FreeGaussian, that mathematically derives dynamic Gaussian motion from optical flow and camera motion using novel dynamic Gaussian constraints. By establishing a connection between 2D flows and 3D Gaussian dynamic control, our method enables self-supervised optimization and continuity of dynamic Gaussian motions from flow priors. Furthermore, we introduce a 3D spherical vector controlling scheme, which represents the state with a 3D Gaussian trajectory, thereby eliminating the need for complex 1D control signal calculations and simplifying controllable Gaussian modeling. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art visual performance and control capability of our method.

Current methods often require manual assignment of precise physical properties for simulations or rely on video generation models to predict them, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we rethink the usage of multi-modal large language model (MLLM) in physics-based simulation, and present Sim Anything, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics. We begin with detailed scene reconstruction and object-level 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, progressing to multi-view image in-painting. Inspired by human visual reasoning, we propose MLLM-based Physical Property Perception (MLLM-P3) to predict mean physical properties of objects in a zero-shot manner. Based on the mean values and the object's geometry, the Material Property Distribution Prediction model (MPDP) model then estimates the full distribution, reformulating the problem as probability distribution estimation to reduce computational costs. Finally, we simulate objects in an open-world scene with particles sampled via the Physical-Geometric Adaptive Sampling (PGAS) strategy, efficiently capturing complex deformations and significantly reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate our Sim Anything achieves more realistic motion than state-of-the-art methods within 2 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have shown promising results separately handling dynamic scenes (4DGS) and view-dependent effects (6DGS), no existing method unifies these capabilities while maintaining real-time performance. We present 7D Gaussian Splatting (7DGS), a unified framework representing scene elements as seven-dimensional Gaussians spanning position (3D), time (1D), and viewing direction (3D). Our key contribution is an efficient conditional slicing mechanism that transforms 7D Gaussians into view- and time-conditioned 3D Gaussians, maintaining compatibility with existing 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines while enabling joint optimization.

However, achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects, but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS), which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms 3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

While 3D-GS has proven to be a useful world model with high-quality rasterizations, it does not natively quantify uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty in parameters of 3D-GS is necessary to understand the information gained from acquiring new images as in active perception, or identify redundant images which can be removed from memory due to resource constraints in online 3D-GS SLAM. We propose to quantify uncertainty and information gain in 3D-GS by reformulating the problem through the lens of optimal experimental design, which is a classical solution to measuring information gain. By restructuring information quantification of 3D-GS through optimal experimental design, we arrive at multiple solutions, of which T-Optimality and D-Optimality perform the best quantitatively and qualitatively as measured on two popular datasets. Additionally, we propose a block diagonal approximation of the 3D-GS uncertainty, which provides a measure of correlation for computing more accurate information gain, at the expense of a greater computation cost.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, it often encounters the dilemma among anchor features, model size, and rendering quality - large anchor features lead to large 3D models and high-quality rendering whereas reducing anchor features degrades Gaussian attribute prediction which leads to clear artifacts in the rendered textures and geometries. We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to enhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to high-quality rendering with small anchor features. Extensive experiments over multiple widely adopted benchmarks show that SOGS achieves superior rendering quality in novel view synthesis with clearly reduced model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/htgs/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP features into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for renderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D features for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D features, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS addresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the prompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly improves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS further decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this granularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the multiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability improvements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an inference speed 2$\times$ faster than baseline methods.

BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enabling the accurate extraction of 3D mesh as in the 2DGS framework. Additionally, the explicit nature of planar primitives enables the use of the ray-tracing effects in rasterization. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, enabling an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model up to x17 times compared to 3DGS. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360. Namely, we achieve a state-of-the-art PSNR of 29.72 for DTU at Full HD resolution.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge in steganography is ensuring imperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However, existing methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only suboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel end-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly optimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our approach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding. The framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret hiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring optimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate steganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce 3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences between original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation space.

| **[Multi-Modal 3D Mesh Reconstruction from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07190v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation for unseen objects is essential in robotics but traditionally relies on trained models that require large datasets, high computational costs, and struggle to generalize. Zero-shot approaches eliminate the need for training but depend on pre-existing 3D object models, which are often impractical to obtain. To address this, we propose a language-guided few-shot 3D reconstruction method, reconstructing a 3D mesh from few input images. In the proposed pipeline, receives a set of input images and a language query. A combination of GroundingDINO and Segment Anything Model outputs segmented masks from which a sparse point cloud is reconstructed with VGGSfM. Subsequently, the mesh is reconstructed with the Gaussian Splatting method SuGAR. In a final cleaning step, artifacts are removed, resulting in the final 3D mesh of the queried object. We evaluate the method in terms of accuracy and quality of the geometry and texture. Furthermore, we study the impact of imaging conditions such as viewing angle, number of input images, and image overlap on 3D object reconstruction quality, efficiency, and computational scalability.</p></details> | under review |

Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

| **[SplatFormer: Point Transformer for Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06390v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently transformed photorealistic reconstruction, achieving high visual fidelity and real-time performance. However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

From the signal processing perspective, representing details usually needs more Gaussians with relatively smaller scales. However, 3DGS currently lacks an explicit constraint linking the density and scale of 3D Gaussians across the domain, leading to 3DGS using improper-scale Gaussians to express frequency information, resulting in the loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation between density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling parameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints (i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency). Furthermore, we develop a frequency-aware density control strategy, consisting of densification and deletion, to improve representation quality with fewer Gaussians. A dynamic threshold encourages densification in high-frequency regions, while a scale-based filter deletes Gaussians with improper scale. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

However, the limited hardware resources on today's mobile platforms hinder these applications, as they struggle to achieve real-time performance. In this paper, we propose SeeLe, a general framework designed to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline for resource-constrained mobile devices. Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing and contribution-aware rasterization. Hybrid preprocessing alleviates the GPU compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions. Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with minimal fine-tuning. Collectively, our framework achieves 2.6$\times$ speedup and 32.3\% model reduction while achieving superior rendering quality compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making it particularly challenging and costly for scene understanding. To address this problem, we introduce a novel hierarchical representation that encodes semantic information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Furthermore, we enhance the whole SLAM system, resulting in improved tracking and mapping performance. Our \MethodName{} outperforms existing dense SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy, while achieving a 2x operation speed-up. Additionally, it achieves on-par semantic rendering performance compared to existing methods while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements. Rendering FPS impressively reaches 2,000 with semantic information and 3,000 without it. Most notably, it showcases the capability of handling the complex real-world scene with more than 500 semantic classes, highlighting its valuable scaling-up capability.

VNMs offer a promising paradigm for image-goal navigation by guiding a robot through a sequence of point-of-view images without requiring metrical localization or environment-specific training. However, constructing a dense and traversable sequence of target viewpoints from start to goal remains a central challenge, particularly when the available image database is sparse. To address these challenges, we propose a 3DGS-based viewpoint synthesis framework for VNMs that synthesizes intermediate viewpoints to seamlessly bridge gaps in sparse data while significantly reducing storage overhead. Experimental results in a photorealistic simulator demonstrate that our approach not only enhances navigation efficiency but also exhibits robustness under varying levels of image database sparsity.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

GS-based rendering for 3D content has gained considerable attention recently. However, there has been limited exploration in directly generating 3D Gaussians compared to traditional generative modeling approaches. The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS represented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels. To overcome this challenge, we propose employing the triplane representation, which allows us to represent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This representation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information, enabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into images by a TriRenderer, with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is fully differentiable, so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and geometry encoding. Furthermore, the triplane representation can be compressed using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which can subsequently be utilized in latent diffusion to generate 3D objects. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and rendering results in the text-to-3D task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Category-level Meta-learned NeRF Priors for Efficient Object Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01582v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D object mapping, category-level priors enable efficient object reconstruction and canonical pose estimation, requiring only a single prior per semantic category (e.g., chair, book, laptop). Recently, DeepSDF has predominantly been used as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct sharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency while enabling canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know objects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction tasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category variations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF architecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training time. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling toward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving reconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results on a low-end GPU highlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with prior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21% lower Chamfer distance, demonstrating better reconstruction quality. Furthermore, evaluations against other approaches using shape priors on a noisy real-world dataset indicate a 13% improvement averaged across all reconstruction metrics, and comparable pose and size estimation accuracy, while being trained for 5x less time.</p></details> |  |

Prior works augment training data only in next-best-view applications, which lead to hallucinations and model collapse with sparse data. In contrast, we propose adding a set of views during training by rejection sampling from a posterior uncertainty distribution, generated by combining a volumetric uncertainty estimator with spatial coverage. We validate our results on partially observed scenes; on average, our method performs 39.9% better with 87.5% less variability across established scene reconstruction benchmarks, as compared to state of the art baselines. We further demonstrate that augmenting the training set by sampling from any distribution leads to better, more consistent scene reconstruction in sparse environments. This work is foundational for robotic tasks where augmenting a dataset with informative data is critical in resource-constrained, a priori unknown environments.

Endoscope-based monocular 3D reconstruction is a promising alternative; however, existing techniques often struggle to achieve the submillimeter precision required for dense reconstruction. In this work, we propose an iterative online learning approach that leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) as an intermediate representation, enabling monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction without relying on prior medical data. Our method attains a point-to-point accuracy below 0.5 mm, with a demonstrated theoretical depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm. We validate our approach across synthetic, phantom, and real endoscopic scenarios, confirming its accuracy and reliability. These results underscore the potential of our pipeline as an iCT alternative, meeting the demanding submillimeter accuracy standards required in ESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[The NeRF Signature: Codebook-Aided Watermarking for Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19125v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been gaining attention as a significant form of 3D content representation. With the proliferation of NeRF-based creations, the need for copyright protection has emerged as a critical issue. Although some approaches have been proposed to embed digital watermarks into NeRF, they often neglect essential model-level considerations and incur substantial time overheads, resulting in reduced imperceptibility and robustness, along with user inconvenience. In this paper, we extend the previous criteria for image watermarking to the model level and propose NeRF Signature, a novel watermarking method for NeRF. We employ a Codebook-aided Signature Embedding (CSE) that does not alter the model structure, thereby maintaining imperceptibility and enhancing robustness at the model level. Furthermore, after optimization, any desired signatures can be embedded through the CSE, and no fine-tuning is required when NeRF owners want to use new binary signatures. Then, we introduce a joint pose-patch encryption watermarking strategy to hide signatures into patches rendered from a specific viewpoint for higher robustness. In addition, we explore a Complexity-Aware Key Selection (CAKS) scheme to embed signatures in high visual complexity patches to enhance imperceptibility. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.

Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We experimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved quality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and rendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

This study addresses the challenge of visualizing objects within large-scale scenes at a high level of detail (LOD) using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The aim is to improve the visual fidelity of chosen objects while maintaining the efficiency of the computations by focusing on details only for relevant content. The proposed ROI-NeRFs framework divides the scene into a Scene NeRF, which represents the overall scene at moderate detail, and multiple ROI NeRFs that focus on user-defined objects of interest. An object-focused camera selection module automatically groups relevant cameras for each NeRF training during the decomposition phase. In the composition phase, a Ray-level Compositional Rendering technique combines information from the Scene NeRF and ROI NeRFs, allowing simultaneous multi-object rendering composition. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, including one on a complex eighteen's century cultural heritage room, demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods, improving LOD for object regions, minimizing artifacts, and without significantly increasing inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including appendix, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces IOVS4NeRF, a framework that employs an uncertainty-guided incremental optimal view selection strategy adaptable to various NeRF implementations. Specifically, by leveraging a hybrid uncertainty model that combines rendering and positional uncertainties, the proposed method calculates the most informative view from among the candidates, thereby enabling incremental optimization of scene reconstruction. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that IOVS4NeRF achieves high-fidelity NeRF reconstruction with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale scene applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.</p></details> | Under review |

In recent years, 3D object generation has made great process and achieved promising results, but it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generating complex, textured, and high-fidelity results. To resolve this problem, we study learning effective NeRFs and SDFs representations with 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D object generation. Specifically, inspired by recent works, we use the efficient geometry-aware 3D GANs as the backbone incorporating with label embedding and color mapping, which enables to train the model on different taxonomies simultaneously. Then, through a decoder, we aggregate the resulting features to generate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) based representations for rendering high-fidelity synthetic images. Meanwhile, we optimize Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to effectively represent objects with 3D meshes. Besides, we observe that this model can be effectively trained with only a few images of each object from a variety of classes, instead of using a great number of images per object or training one model per class. With this pipeline, we can optimize an effective model for 3D object generation. This solution is among the top 3 in the ICCV 2023 OmniObject3D Challenge.</p></details> |  |

Especially, we argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</p></details> |  |

Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, submitted to ICLR2025</p></details> |

Previous attempts either focus on reconstructing single reflective objects or rely on strong supervision guidance in terms of additional user-provided annotations of visible image regions of the mirrors, thereby limiting the practical usability. In contrast, in this paper, we present NeRF-MD, a method which shows that NeRFs can be considered as mirror detectors and which is capable of reconstructing neural radiance fields of scenes containing mirroring surfaces without the need for prior annotations. To this end, we first compute an initial estimate of the scene geometry by training a standard NeRF using a depth reprojection loss. Our key insight lies in the fact that parts of the scene corresponding to a mirroring surface will still exhibit a significant photometric inconsistency, whereas the remaining parts are already reconstructed in a plausible manner. This allows us to detect mirror surfaces by fitting geometric primitives to such inconsistent regions in this initial stage of the training. Using this information, we then jointly optimize the radiance field and mirror geometry in a second training stage to refine their quality. We demonstrate the capability of our method to allow the faithful detection of mirrors in the scene as well as the reconstruction of a single consistent scene representation, and demonstrate its potential in comparison to baseline and mirror-aware approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density for Neural Implicit Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727v2)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in the volume density by modeling uncertainty in the occupancy, without the need for additional networks, making it particularly suited for challenging observations and uncontrolled image environments. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by providing an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in addressing uncertainties solely through geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies when interpreting scenes with insufficient real-world observations. While previous efforts have relied on auxiliary networks, we propose a series of formulation extensions to NeRF that manage uncertainties in density, both color and density, and occupancy, all without the need for additional networks. In experiments, we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset. Given that uncertainty modeling aligns well with the inherently uncertain environments of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we applied our approach to SLAM systems and observed notable improvements in mapping and tracking performance. These results confirm the effectiveness of our Bayesian NeRF approach in quantifying uncertainty based on geometric structure, making it a robust solution for challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Previous works (e.g, NeRF-Det) have demonstrated that implicit representation has the capacity to benefit the visual 3D perception task in indoor scenes with high amount of overlap between input images. However, previous works cannot fully utilize the advancement of implicit representation because of fixed sampling and simple multi-view feature fusion. In this paper, inspired by sparse fashion method (e.g, DETR3D), we propose a simple yet effective method, NeRF-DetS, to address above issues. NeRF-DetS includes two modules: Progressive Adaptive Sampling Strategy (PASS) and Depth-Guided Simplified Multi-Head Attention Fusion (DS-MHA). Specifically, (1)PASS can automatically sample features of each layer within a dense 3D detector, using offsets predicted by the previous layer. (2)DS-MHA can not only efficiently fuse multi-view features with strong occlusion awareness but also reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate our NeRF-DetS outperforms NeRF-Det, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP under IoU25 and IoU50, respectively.

We propose that identifying and establishing fine-grained and generalizable correspondences between driving signals and generated results can simultaneously resolve both problems. Here we present LokiTalk, a novel framework designed to enhance NeRF-based talking heads with lifelike facial dynamics and improved training efficiency. To achieve fine-grained correspondences, we introduce Region-Specific Deformation Fields, which decompose the overall portrait motion into lip movements, eye blinking, head pose, and torso movements. By hierarchically modeling the driving signals and their associated regions through two cascaded deformation fields, we significantly improve dynamic accuracy and minimize synthetic artifacts. Furthermore, we propose ID-Aware Knowledge Transfer, a plug-and-play module that learns generalizable dynamic and static correspondences from multi-identity videos, while simultaneously extracting ID-specific dynamic and static features to refine the depiction of individual characters. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LokiTalk delivers superior high-fidelity results and training efficiency compared to previous methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/LokiTalk/</p></details> |

These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds. Our code will be made publically available.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial vulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat landscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), remains underexplored. This work introduces \textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework for crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \textit{AdvIRL} generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box attacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range of scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g., lighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence misclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a cannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond attacking, \textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as adversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems. The implementation of \textit{AdvIRL} is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Tommy-Nguyen-cpu/AdvIRL/tree/MultiView-Clean}, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

However, the substantial data volumes pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing solutions typically optimize NeRF representation and compression independently or focus on a single fixed rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff. In this paper, we propose VRVVC, a novel end-to-end joint optimization variable-rate framework for volumetric video compression that achieves variable bitrates using a single model while maintaining superior RD performance. Specifically, VRVVC introduces a compact tri-plane implicit residual representation for inter-frame modeling of long-duration dynamic scenes, effectively reducing temporal redundancy. We further propose a variable-rate residual representation compression scheme that leverages a learnable quantization and a tiny MLP-based entropy model. This approach enables variable bitrates through the utilization of predefined Lagrange multipliers to manage the quantization error of all latent representations. Finally, we present an end-to-end progressive training strategy combined with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRVVC achieves a wide range of variable bitrates within a single model and surpasses the RD performance of existing methods across various datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references. An implementation of this paper are available at https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-NQA.</p></details> |  |

While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improved training efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024 https://github.com/sbsws88/TFS-NeRF</p></details> |

However, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their ineffective utilization of 2D diffusion priors. The limitations manifest in two critical aspects: the inadequate capture of geometric information by pretrained diffusion models and the suboptimal guidance provided by existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. To address these problems, we introduce GB-NeRF, a novel framework that enhances NeRF inpainting through improved utilization of 2D diffusion priors. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a fine-tuning strategy that simultaneously learns appearance and geometric priors and a specialized normal distillation loss that integrates these geometric priors into NeRF inpainting. We propose a technique called Balanced Score Distillation (BSD) that surpasses existing methods such as Score Distillation (SDS) and the improved version, Conditional Score Distillation (CSD). BSD offers improved inpainting quality in appearance and geometric aspects. Extensive experiments show that our method provides superior appearance fidelity and geometric consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Towards Degradation-Robust Reconstruction in Generalizable NeRF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11691v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) across scenes has been proven to be an effective way to avoid per-scene optimization by representing a scene with deep image features of source images. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, there has been limited research on the robustness of GNeRFs to different types of degradation present in the source images. The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments.

Building on disentangled Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed in varying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can then be applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectively rendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity. Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn various transformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlight not only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practical applications in computer graphics.

However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency.

Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS)</p></details> |

Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024</p></details> |

We close this gap with ProvNeRF, an approach that models the \textbf{provenance} for each point -- i.e., the locations where it is likely visible -- of NeRFs as a stochastic field. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional space with an optimizable objective. We show that modeling per-point provenance during the NeRF optimization enriches the model with information on triangulation leading to improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty estimation under the challenging sparse, unconstrained view setting against competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

NeRF uses a volumetric functional representation that maps 3D points to their corresponding colors and opacities, allowing for photorealistic view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. Despite its advancements, the efficient streaming of NeRF content remains a significant challenge due to the large amount of data involved. This paper investigates the rate-distortion performance of two NeRF streaming strategies: pixel-based and neural network (NN) parameter-based streaming. While in the former, images are coded and then transmitted throughout the network, in the latter, the respective NeRF model parameters are coded and transmitted instead. This work also highlights the trade-offs in complexity and performance, demonstrating that the NN parameter-based strategy generally offers superior efficiency, making it suitable for one-to-many streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent works demonstrate that the frequency regularization of Positional Encoding (PE) can achieve promising results for few-shot NeRF. In this work, we reveal that there exists an inconsistency between the frequency regularization of PE and rendering loss. This prevents few-shot NeRF from synthesizing higher-quality novel views. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision. In this way, AR-NeRF can learn global structures better in the early training phase and adaptively learn local details throughout the training process. Extensive experiments show that our AR-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, including object-level and complex scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

These developments present new opportunities for reusing these maps for localization. However, there remains a lack of a unified approach that can operate seamlessly across different map representations. This paper presents and evaluates a global visual localization system capable of localizing a single camera image across various 3D map representations built using both visual and lidar sensing. Our system generates a database by synthesizing novel views of the scene, creating RGB and depth image pairs. Leveraging the precise 3D geometric map, our method automatically defines rendering poses, reducing the number of database images while preserving retrieval performance. To bridge the domain gap between real query camera images and synthetic database images, our approach utilizes learning-based descriptors and feature detectors. We evaluate the system's performance through extensive real-world experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings, assessing the effectiveness of each map representation and demonstrating its advantages over traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) localization approaches. The results show that all three map representations can achieve consistent localization success rates of 55% and higher across various environments. NeRF synthesized images show superior performance, localizing query images at an average success rate of 72%. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advantage over SfM-based approaches that our synthesized database enables localization in the reverse travel direction which is unseen during the mapping process. Our system, operating in real-time on a mobile laptop equipped with a GPU, achieves a processing rate of 1Hz.</p></details> |  |

In this work, We propose GL-NeRF, a new perspective of computing volume rendering with the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Depth-supervised NeRF: Fewer Views and Faster Training for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02791v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A commonly observed failure mode of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is fitting incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsnerf/ GitHub: https://github.com/dunbar12138/DSNeRF</p></details> |
| **[EG-HumanNeRF: Efficient Generalizable Human NeRF Utilizing Human Prior for Sparse View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12242v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF) enables neural-based digital human rendering without per-scene retraining. When combined with human prior knowledge, high-quality human rendering can be achieved even with sparse input views. However, the inference of these methods is still slow, as a large number of neural network queries on each ray are required to ensure the rendering quality. Moreover, occluded regions often suffer from artifacts, especially when the input views are sparse. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable human NeRF framework that achieves high-quality and real-time rendering with sparse input views by extensively leveraging human prior knowledge. We accelerate the rendering with a two-stage sampling reduction strategy: first constructing boundary meshes around the human geometry to reduce the number of ray samples for sampling guidance regression, and then volume rendering using fewer guided samples. To improve rendering quality, especially in occluded regions, we propose an occlusion-aware attention mechanism to extract occlusion information from the human priors, followed by an image space refinement network to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, for volume rendering, we adopt a signed ray distance function (SRDF) formulation, which allows us to propose an SRDF loss at every sample position to improve the rendering quality further. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and has a competitive rendering speed compared with speed-prioritized novel view synthesis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/LarsPh/EG-HumanNeRF</p></details> |
| **[NeRF-enabled Analysis-Through-Synthesis for ISAR Imaging of Small Everyday Objects with Sparse and Noisy UWB Radar Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10085v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging presents a formidable challenge when it comes to small everyday objects due to their limited Radar Cross-Section (RCS) and the inherent resolution constraints of radar systems. Existing ISAR reconstruction methods including backprojection (BP) often require complex setups and controlled environments, rendering them impractical for many real-world noisy scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Analysis-through-Synthesis (ATS) framework enabled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for high-resolution coherent ISAR imaging of small objects using sparse and noisy Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data with an inexpensive and portable setup. Our end-to-end framework integrates ultra-wideband radar wave propagation, reflection characteristics, and scene priors, enabling efficient 2D scene reconstruction without the need for costly anechoic chambers or complex measurement test beds. With qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques and generates ISAR images of complex scenes with multiple targets and complex structures in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and noisy scenarios, particularly with limited number of views and sparse UWB radar scans. This work represents a significant step towards practical, cost-effective ISAR imaging of small everyday objects, with broad implications for robotics and mobile sensing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

Existing NeRFs are designed based on a key assumption that the target scene remains unchanged between the training and test time. However, small but unpredictable perturbations such as object movements, light changes and data contaminations broadly exist in real-life 3D scenes, which lead to significantly defective or failed rendering results even for the recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework in OPONeRF that adaptively responds to local scene variations via personalizing appropriate point-wise parameters, instead of fitting a single set of NeRF parameters that are inactive to test-time unseen changes. Moreover, to explicitly capture the local uncertainty, we decompose the point representation into deterministic mapping and probabilistic inference. In this way, OPONeRF learns the sharable invariance and unsupervisedly models the unexpected scene variations between the training and testing scenes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct benchmarks from both realistic and synthetic data with diverse test-time perturbations including foreground motions, illumination variations and multi-modality noises, which are more challenging than conventional generalization and temporal reconstruction benchmarks. Experimental results show that our OPONeRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRFs on various evaluation metrics through benchmark experiments and cross-scene evaluations. We further show the efficacy of the proposed method via experimenting on other existing generalization-based benchmarks and incorporating the idea of One-Point-One NeRF into other advanced baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and dataset: https://yzheng97.github.io/OPONeRF/</p></details> |

Despite demonstrating impressive rendering speed and quality, the rapid convergence of such models poses challenges for further improving reconstruction quality. Common strategies to improve rendering quality involves augmenting model parameters or increasing the number of sampled points. However, these computationally intensive approaches encounter limitations in achieving significant quality enhancements. This study introduces a model-agnostic framework inspired by Sparsely-Gated Mixture of Experts to enhance rendering quality without escalating computational complexity. Our approach enables specialization in rendering different scene components by employing a mixture of experts with varying resolutions. We present a novel gate formulation designed to maximize expert capabilities and propose a resolution-based routing technique to effectively induce sparsity and decompose scenes. Our work significantly improves reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to the ECCV 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Deformable NeRF using Recursively Subdivided Tetrahedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04402v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promise in novel view synthesis, their implicit representation limits explicit control over object manipulation. Existing research has proposed the integration of explicit geometric proxies to enable deformation. However, these methods face two primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks.

However, a collaborative approach requires a distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with less accurate relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

| **[Distributed NeRF Learning for Collaborative Multi-Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20289v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective environment perception is crucial for enabling downstream robotic applications. Individual robotic agents often face occlusion and limited visibility issues, whereas multi-agent systems can offer a more comprehensive mapping of the environment, quicker coverage, and increased fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a collaborative multi-agent perception system where agents collectively learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) from posed RGB images to represent a scene. Each agent processes its local sensory data and shares only its learned NeRF model with other agents, reducing communication overhead. Given NeRF's low memory footprint, this approach is well-suited for robotic systems with limited bandwidth, where transmitting all raw data is impractical. Our distributed learning framework ensures consistency across agents' local NeRF models, enabling convergence to a unified scene representation. We show the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments on datasets containing challenging real-world scenes, achieving performance comparable to centralized mapping of the environment where data is sent to a central server for processing. Additionally, we find that multi-agent learning provides regularization benefits, improving geometric consistency in scenarios with sparse input views. We show that in such scenarios, multi-agent mapping can even outperform centralized training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints. This capability has significant advantages for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling, and content creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics. This paper addresses the problem of NeRF view synthesis (NVS) quality assessment thoroughly, by conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several scene classes and recently proposed NVS methods. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. This study found that errors in camera pose estimation can result in spatial misalignments between synthesized and reference images, which need to be corrected before applying an objective quality metric. The experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation of several NVS methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and 360-degree camera trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Recent advances have shown promise in merging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However, one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of 'guidance collapse' and further enhance scene consistency, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object-specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a complex text into the layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next, a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts accuracy. Noticeably, our composition design permits decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open-source Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF generates multi-object scenes with high fidelity. Remarkably, our framework achieves up to a \textbf{54\%} improvement by the multi-view CLIP score metric. Our user study indicates that our method has significantly improved semantic accuracy, multi-view consistency, and individual recognizability for multi-object scene generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ternary-Type Opacity and Hybrid Odometry for RGB NeRF-SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the challenge of deploying Neural Radiance Field (NeRFs) in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) under the condition of lacking depth information, relying solely on RGB inputs. The key to unlocking the full potential of NeRF in such a challenging context lies in the integration of real-world priors. A crucial prior we explore is the binary opacity prior of 3D space with opaque objects. To effectively incorporate this prior into the NeRF framework, we introduce a ternary-type opacity (TT) model instead, which categorizes points on a ray intersecting a surface into three regions: before, on, and behind the surface. This enables a more accurate rendering of depth, subsequently improving the performance of image warping techniques. Therefore, we further propose a novel hybrid odometry (HO) scheme that merges bundle adjustment and warping-based localization. Our integrated approach of TT and HO achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, in terms of both speed and accuracy. This breakthrough underscores the potential of NeRF-SLAM in navigating complex environments with high fidelity.</p></details> | IROS 2024 |

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instant Uncertainty Calibration of NeRFs Using a Meta-Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02350v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have markedly improved novel view synthesis, accurate uncertainty quantification in their image predictions remains an open problem. The prevailing methods for estimating uncertainty, including the state-of-the-art Density-aware NeRF Ensembles (DANE) [29], quantify uncertainty without calibration. This frequently leads to over- or under-confidence in image predictions, which can undermine their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method which, for the first time, achieves calibrated uncertainties for NeRFs. To accomplish this, we overcome a significant challenge in adapting existing calibration techniques to NeRFs: a need to hold out ground truth images from the target scene, reducing the number of images left to train the NeRF. This issue is particularly problematic in sparse-view settings, where we can operate with as few as three images. To address this, we introduce the concept of a meta-calibrator that performs uncertainty calibration for NeRFs with a single forward pass without the need for holding out any images from the target scene. Our meta-calibrator is a neural network that takes as input the NeRF images and uncalibrated uncertainty maps and outputs a scene-specific calibration curve that corrects the NeRF's uncalibrated uncertainties. We show that the meta-calibrator can generalize on unseen scenes and achieves well-calibrated and state-of-the-art uncertainty for NeRFs, significantly beating DANE and other approaches. This opens opportunities to improve applications that rely on accurate NeRF uncertainty estimates such as next-best view planning and potentially more trustworthy image reconstruction for medical diagnosis.

Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit-NeRF-QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects. By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024.

This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method.

In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call \textit{NeRFmentation}, trains NeRFs on each scene in a dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset, KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving dataset, and our own synthetic test set.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses key challenges in multi-robot 3D reconstruction, including inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. We introduce a method for using wireless Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and ranging measurements to estimate relative poses between robots, as well as quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty embedded in the wireless localization of these pose estimates into the NeRF training loss to mitigate the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Furthermore, we propose an active view selection approach that accounts for robot pose uncertainty when determining the next-best views to improve the 3D reconstruction, enabling faster convergence through intelligent view selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in theory and in practice. Leveraging wireless coordination and localization uncertainty-aware training, MULAN-WC can achieve high-quality 3d reconstruction which is close to applying the ground truth camera poses. Furthermore, the quantification of the information gain from a novel view enables consistent rendering quality improvement with incrementally captured images by commending the robot the novel view position. Our hardware experiments showcase the practicality of deploying MULAN-WC to real robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of predicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide enough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries yielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision during NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be perfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more challenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in depth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or uncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know that depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through L2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth metrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'24), October 14-18, 2024, Salt Lake City, UT, USA</p></details> |
| **[Spiking NeRF: Representing the Real-World Geometry by a Discontinuous Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09077v3)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial reason for the success of existing NeRF-based methods is to build a neural density field for the geometry representation via multiple perceptron layers (MLPs). MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry. Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our method achieves SOTA performance.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which provide the current benchmark in terms of quality for the generation of novel views of complex 3D scenes from a limited set of 2D images, represent a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training of these models requires the knowledge of the respective camera positions from which the images were viewed. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing HyperNeRFGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture employing a hypernetwork paradigm to transform a Gaussian noise into the weights of a NeRF architecture that does not utilize viewing directions in its training phase. Consequently, as evidenced by the findings of our experimental study, the proposed model, despite its notable simplicity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrates superior performance on a diverse range of image datasets where camera position estimation is challenging, particularly in the context of medical data.</p></details> |  |

Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p></details> | ECCV24 camera ready |

Previous solutions for learning NeRFs with sparse views and noisy poses only consider local geometry consistency with pairs of views. Closely following \textit{bundle adjustment} in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), we introduce TrackNeRF for more globally consistent geometry reconstruction and more accurate pose optimization. TrackNeRF introduces \textit{feature tracks}, \ie connected pixel trajectories across \textit{all} visible views that correspond to the \textit{same} 3D points. By enforcing reprojection consistency among feature tracks, TrackNeRF encourages holistic 3D consistency explicitly. Through extensive experiments, TrackNeRF sets a new benchmark in noisy and sparse view reconstruction. In particular, TrackNeRF shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art BARF and SPARF by $\sim8$ and $\sim1$ in terms of PSNR on DTU under various sparse and noisy view setups.

However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide a robust solution for real-time robotic navigation. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in a photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024, 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the occlusion of invisible voxels by scene surfaces poses challenges to current SSC methods in hallucinating refined 3D geometry. This paper proposes HybridOcc, a hybrid 3D volume query proposal method generated by Transformer framework and NeRF representation and refined in a coarse-to-fine SSC prediction framework. HybridOcc aggregates contextual features through the Transformer paradigm based on hybrid query proposals while combining it with NeRF representation to obtain depth supervision. The Transformer branch contains multiple scales and uses spatial cross-attention for 2D to 3D transformation. The newly designed NeRF branch implicitly infers scene occupancy through volume rendering, including visible and invisible voxels, and explicitly captures scene depth rather than generating RGB color. Furthermore, we present an innovative occupancy-aware ray sampling method to orient the SSC task instead of focusing on the scene surface, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HybridOcc on the SSC task.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE RAL |

Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to reconstruct the dynamic scenes and struggle to fit even the training views in unsynchronized settings. It happens because they employ a single latent embedding for a frame while the multi-view images at the same frame were actually captured at different moments. To address this limitation, we introduce time offsets for individual unsynchronized videos and jointly optimize the offsets with NeRF. By design, our method is applicable for various baselines and improves them with large margins. Furthermore, finding the offsets naturally works as synchronizing the videos without manual effort. Experiments are conducted on the common Plenoptic Video Dataset and a newly built Unsynchronized Dynamic Blender Dataset to verify the performance of our method.

However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually fail to capture the complex geometric details of plants, which is crucial for phenotyping and breeding studies. We evaluate the reconstruction fidelity of NeRFs in three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.6% F1 score after 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficacy of NeRFs for 3D reconstruction in challenging environments. Additionally, we propose an early stopping technique for NeRF training that almost halves the training time while achieving only a reduction of 7.4% in the average F1 score. This optimization process significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of 3D reconstruction using NeRFs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of NeRFs in detailed and realistic 3D plant reconstruction and suggest practical approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency of NeRFs in the 3D reconstruction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 'Plant Phenomics'</p></details> |

NeRF models produce state-of-the-art quality for many 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks but require substantial computational resources. The encoding of the scene information within the NeRF network parameters necessitates stochastic sampling. We observe that during the training, a major part of the compute time and memory usage is spent on processing already learnt samples, which no longer affect the model update significantly. We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph. As our method only interfaces with the network module, we expect it to be widely applicable.</p></details> |  |

While many works have focused on generating 3D human models, they suffer one or more of the following: lack of distinctive features, unnatural shading/shadows, unnatural poses/clothes, limited views, etc. InceptionHuman achieves consistent 3D human generation within a progressively refined NeRF space with two novel modules, Iterative Pose-Aware Refinement (IPAR) and Progressive-Augmented Reconstruction (PAR). IPAR iteratively refines the diffusion-generated images and synthesizes high-quality 3D-aware views considering the close-pose RGB values. PAR employs a pretrained diffusion prior to augment the generated synthetic views and adds regularization for view-independent appearance. Overall, the synthesis of photorealistic novel views empowers the resulting 3D human NeRF from 360-degree perspectives. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison show that our InceptionHuman models achieve state-of-the-art application quality.</p></details> |  |

Although there are extensive works on image-level attacks, most are restricted to 2D pixel spaces, and such attacks are not always physically realistic in our 3D world. Here we present Adv3D, the first exploration of modeling adversarial examples as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Advances in NeRF provide photorealistic appearances and 3D accurate generation, yielding a more realistic and realizable adversarial example. We train our adversarial NeRF by minimizing the surrounding objects' confidence predicted by 3D detectors on the training set. Then we evaluate Adv3D on the unseen validation set and show that it can cause a large performance reduction when rendering NeRF in any sampled pose. To generate physically realizable adversarial examples, we propose primitive-aware sampling and semantic-guided regularization that enable 3D patch attacks with camouflage adversarial texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained adversarial NeRF generalizes well to different poses, scenes, and 3D detectors. Finally, we provide a defense method to our attacks that involves adversarial training through data augmentation. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/adv3d-web</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges.

Traditionally, 3D mapping, or scene reconstruction, has relied on expensive LiDAR sensing. Photogrammetry can perform image-based 3D reconstruction but is computationally expensive and requires extremely dense image representation to recover complex geometry and photorealism. NeRFs perform 3D scene reconstruction by training a neural network on sparse image and pose data, achieving superior results to photogrammetry with less input data. This paper presents an evaluation of two NeRF scene reconstructions for the purpose of estimating the diameter of a vertical PVC cylinder. One of these are trained on commodity iPhone data and the other is trained on robot-sourced imagery and poses. This neural-geometry is compared to state-of-the-art lidar-inertial SLAM in terms of scene noise and metric-accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes.

Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.</p></details> | accepted to eccv2024 |

We also design a single reconstruction process that takes advantage of those inductive biases and experimentally demonstrates on-par performances in terms of quality with dedicated architecture on multiple tasks (anti-aliasing, few view reconstruction, SDF reconstruction without scene-specific initialization) while being more efficient.

While gradient-based optimization in a NeRF framework updates the initial pose, this paper highlights that scale-depth ambiguity in monocular object reconstruction causes failures when the initial pose deviates moderately from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present SUP-NeRF, a Streamlined Unification of object Pose estimation and NeRF-based object reconstruction. SUP-NeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces a camera-invariant projected-box representation that generalizes cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, SUP-NeRF is free from external 3D detectors. SUP-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, SUP-NeRF exhibits exceptional cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50\% reduction in rotation and translation error.</p></details> |  |

With the rising prominence and influence of NeRF, safeguarding its intellectual property has become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose \textbf{NeRFProtector}, which adopts a plug-and-play strategy to protect NeRF's copyright during its creation. NeRFProtector utilizes a pre-trained watermarking base model, enabling NeRF creators to embed binary messages directly while creating their NeRF.

| **[Crowd-Sourced NeRF: Collecting Data from Production Vehicles for 3D Street View Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16289v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis. Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF-Guided Unsupervised Learning of RGB-D Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00507v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration. Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field (NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model. Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset, Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper reproduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matching Query Image Against Selected NeRF Feature for Efficient and Scalable Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11766v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit representations such as NeRF have revolutionized 3D scene representation with photo-realistic quality. However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Our method defines the transformation as a 3D flow, specifically as a weighted linear blending of rigid transformations of 3D anchor points that are defined on the surface of the scene. In order to identify anchor points, we introduce a novel correspondence algorithm that first matches RGB-based pairs, then leverages multi-view information and 3D reprojection to robustly filter false positives in two steps. We also introduce a new dataset for exploring the problem of modifying a NeRF scene through a single observation. Our dataset ( https://github.com/nerfdeformer/nerfdeformer ) contains 113 synthetic scenes leveraging 47 3D assets. We show that our proposed method outperforms NeRF editing methods as well as diffusion-based methods, and we also explore different methods for filtering correspondences.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main paper, CVPR 2024.

Key to our approach are: (i) a dynamic hypernetwork, which learns a smooth mapping from text token embeddings to the space of NeRFs; (ii) NeRF distillation training, which distills scenes encoded in individual NeRFs into one dynamic hypernetwork. These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes -- either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024, Project page: https://threedle.github.io/hyperfields/</p></details> |
| **[Neural NeRF Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08943v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as powerful tools for capturing detailed 3D scenes through continuous volumetric representations. Recent NeRFs utilize feature grids to improve rendering quality and speed; however, these representations introduce significant storage overhead. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently compressing a grid-based NeRF model, addressing the storage overhead concern. Our approach is based on the non-linear transform coding paradigm, employing neural compression for compressing the model's feature grids. Due to the lack of training data involving many i.i.d scenes, we design an encoder-free, end-to-end optimized approach for individual scenes, using lightweight decoders. To leverage the spatial inhomogeneity of the latent feature grids, we introduce an importance-weighted rate-distortion objective and a sparse entropy model employing a masking mechanism. Our experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing works in terms of grid-based NeRF compression efficacy and reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[NeRF Director: Revisiting View Selection in Neural Volume Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08839v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Rendering representations have significantly contributed to the field of 3D computer vision. Given their potential, considerable efforts have been invested to improve their performance. Nonetheless, the essential question of selecting training views is yet to be thoroughly investigated. This key aspect plays a vital role in achieving high-quality results and aligns with the well-known tenet of deep learning: "garbage in, garbage out". In this paper, we first illustrate the importance of view selection by demonstrating how a simple rotation of the test views within the most pervasive NeRF dataset can lead to consequential shifts in the performance rankings of state-of-the-art techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a unified framework for view selection methods and devise a thorough benchmark to assess its impact. Significant improvements can be achieved without leveraging error or uncertainty estimation but focusing on uniform view coverage of the reconstructed object, resulting in a training-free approach. Using this technique, we show that high-quality renderings can be achieved faster by using fewer views. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and realistic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with random, conventional error-based, and uncertainty-guided view selection.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |
| **[Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729v5)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Lifting of Multiview to 3D from Unknown Pose: Wrapping NeRF inside Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06972v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We cast multiview reconstruction from unknown pose as a generative modeling problem. From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  |

To expedite the rendering process, learnable explicit representations have been introduced for combination with implicit NeRF representation, which however results in a large storage space requirement. In this paper, we introduce the Context-based NeRF Compression (CNC) framework, which leverages highly efficient context models to provide a storage-friendly NeRF representation. Specifically, we excavate both level-wise and dimension-wise context dependencies to enable probability prediction for information entropy reduction. Additionally, we exploit hash collision and occupancy grids as strong prior knowledge for better context modeling. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct and exploit context models for NeRF compression. We achieve a size reduction of 100$\times$ and 70$\times$ with improved fidelity against the baseline Instant-NGP on Synthesic-NeRF and Tanks and Temples datasets, respectively. Additionally, we attain 86.7\% and 82.3\% storage size reduction against the SOTA NeRF compression method BiRF.

However, the scalability and accuracy of the inferred geometry are not well-documented for large-scale aerial assets,since such datasets usually result in very high memory consumption and slow convergence.. In this paper, we aim to scale the NeRF on large-scael aerial datasets and provide a thorough geometry assessment of NeRF. Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image loading for RAM, representation training for GPU memory, and increase the convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a loss of accuracy. We implement our method on a representative approach, Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS pipelines on two typical aerial datasets against LiDAR reference data. Both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the proposed NeRF approach produces better completeness and object details than traditional approaches, although as of now, it still falls short in terms of accuracy.</p></details> | 9 Figure |

Standard simulator-based rendering often fails to accurately reflect real-world performance due to the sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between virtual simulations and real-world conditions. To mitigate this gap, we propose a workflow for building a high-fidelity simulation environment of the targeted real-world scene using NeRF. This approach is capable of rendering realistic images from novel viewpoints and constructing 3D meshes for emulating collisions. The validation of these capabilities through the comparison of success rates in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the benefits of using DriveEnv-NeRF as a real-world performance indicator. Furthermore, the DriveEnv-NeRF framework can serve as a training environment for autonomous driving agents under various lighting conditions. This approach enhances the robustness of the agents and reduces performance degradation when deployed to the target real scene, compared to agents fully trained using the standard simulator rendering pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/muyishen2040/DriveEnvNeRF</p></details> |

| **[MetaScale: Test-Time Scaling with Evolving Meta-Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13447v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |

Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding.

(ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://videomind.github.io/</p></details> |

DomainCodeBench: A Multi-domain Code Generation Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18573v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), extensive research has been conducted to investigate the code generation capabilities of LLMs. However, existing efforts primarily focus on general-domain tasks, leaving LLMs' code generation performance in real-world application domains underexplored. This raises a critical question: can a model's general-domain coding ability reliably represent its ability in specialized domains? In this paper, we introduce DomainCodeBench, a multi-domain code generation benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs across 12 software application domains and 15 programming languages. DomainCodeBench contains 2,400 manually verified tasks with ground truth, human-annotated docstrings, and fine-grained dependency information to ensure more coverage of domain-specific challenges. Specifically, we first identify the most popular application domains by topic mining. Then, we curate coding tasks based on commonly used frameworks and platforms in each domain. We obtain several findings through extensive experiments on DomainCodeBench with ten mainstream LLMs. (1) Performance decoupling: experiments reveal that top general-domain models do not consistently excel in specific application domains; (2) Domain-specific weaknesses: LLMs often fail due to domain knowledge gaps and third-party library misusage; (3) Contextual enhancement: we show that augmenting prompts with domain-specific knowledge improves performance by around 38.17%, providing actionable insights for performance optimization.

Therefore, inference speed is one of the most critical properties of LLM architectures, and there is a growing need for LLMs that are efficient and fast at inference. Recently, LLMs built on the xLSTM architecture have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformers, offering linear compute scaling with sequence length and constant memory usage, both highly desirable properties for efficient inference. However, such xLSTM-based LLMs have yet to be scaled to larger models and assessed and compared with respect to inference speed and efficiency. In this work, we introduce xLSTM 7B, a 7-billion-parameter LLM that combines xLSTM's architectural benefits with targeted optimizations for fast and efficient inference. Our experiments demonstrate that xLSTM 7B achieves performance on downstream tasks comparable to other similar-sized LLMs, while providing significantly faster inference speeds and greater efficiency compared to Llama- and Mamba-based LLMs. These results establish xLSTM 7B as the fastest and most efficient 7B LLM, offering a solution for tasks that require large amounts of test-time computation.

These ``AI clones'' or ``AI agents'' have the potential to transform how people search over one another in contexts ranging from marriage to employment -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun using AI clones to evaluate potential pairings between users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones, and their imperfect representation of humans. Individual personalities are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations of these personalities. I compare two search regimes: an ``in-person regime'' -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an ``AI representation regime'' -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a better expected match than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</p></details> |  |

Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks.

However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation. We hope our study not only provides valuable guidance for future research but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in prompt optimization.

Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that harmful perturbation over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

However, their stability and generalizability are compromised due to the vulnerability to experimental setups and validation protocols, falling short of surpassing random sampling (Diddee & Ippolito, 2024; Xia et al., 2024b). Built upon LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), combined with the sheer token volume and heightened heterogeneity of data sources, amplify both the significance and complexity of data selection. To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner, we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14 vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate. To promote diversity, in light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data instruction patterns. In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler (mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in diversified forms. Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling, mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints, supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation. Across 10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies and state-of-the-art selection methods, achieving 99.1% of full performance with only 30% of the 2.6M data.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update comparison with sota and analysis</p></details> |

During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at https://sun-hailong.github.io/projects/TVC</p></details> |

By transforming decision-making problems into language modeling tasks, our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate behavior trees represented in domain-specific language (DSL). This method eliminates the computational burden associated with traditional reinforcement learning approaches while preserving strategic depth and rapid adaptability. Our framework introduces a hybrid policy structure that combines rule-based nodes with neural network components, enabling both high-level strategic reasoning and precise low-level control. A dual-feedback mechanism incorporating quantitative game metrics and vision-language model analysis facilitates iterative policy improvement at both tactical and strategic levels. The resulting policies are instantaneously deployable, human-interpretable, and capable of generalizing across diverse gaming environments. Experimental results demonstrate PORTAL's effectiveness across thousands of first-person shooter (FPS) games, showcasing significant improvements in development efficiency, policy generalization, and behavior diversity compared to traditional approaches. PORTAL represents a significant advancement in game AI development, offering a practical solution for creating sophisticated agents that can operate across thousands of commercial video games with minimal development overhead.

Without hard constraints on syntax and database schema, they occasionally produce invalid queries that are not executable. These failures limit the usage of these systems in real-life scenarios. We propose a neurosymbolic framework that imposes SQL syntax and schema constraints with unification-based definite clause grammars and thus guarantees the generation of valid queries. Our framework also builds a bi-directional interface to language models to leverage their natural language understanding abilities. The evaluation results on a subset of SQL grammars show that all our output queries are valid. This work is the first step towards extending language models with unification-based grammars. We demonstrate this extension enhances the validity, execution accuracy, and ground truth alignment of the underlying language model by a large margin.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), promise powerful tools and capabilities to enhance personalized learning in online educational environments. In this work, we explore how LLMs can improve personalized learning experiences by catering to individual user needs toward enhancing the overall quality of online education. We designed personalization guidelines based on the growing literature on personalized learning to ground LLMs in generating tailored learning plans. To operationalize these guidelines, we implemented LearnMate, an LLM-based system that generates personalized learning plans and provides users with real-time learning support. We discuss the implications and future directions of this work, aiming to move beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach by integrating LLM-based personalized support into online learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ex...</summary><p>In Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nullu: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via HalluSpace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13817v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large vision-language models (LVLMs) often suffer from the issue of object hallucinations (OH). To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient method that edits the model weights based on an unsafe subspace, which we call HalluSpace in this paper. With truthful and hallucinated text prompts accompanying the visual content as inputs, the HalluSpace can be identified by extracting the hallucinated embedding features and removing the truthful representations in LVLMs. By orthogonalizing the model weights, input features will be projected into the Null space of the HalluSpace to reduce OH, based on which we name our method Nullu. We reveal that HalluSpaces generally contain prior information in the large language models (LLMs) applied to build LVLMs, which have been shown as essential causes of OH in previous studies. Therefore, null space projection suppresses the LLMs' priors to filter out the hallucinated features, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Experiments show that our method can effectively mitigate OH across different LVLM families without extra inference costs and also show strong performance in general LVLM benchmarks. Code is released at https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/Nullu.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Edit Transfer: Learning Image Editing via Vision In-Context Relations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13327v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new setting, Edit Transfer, where a model learns a transformation from just a single source-target example and applies it to a new query image. While text-based methods excel at semantic manipulations through textual prompts, they often struggle with precise geometric details (e.g., poses and viewpoint changes). Reference-based editing, on the other hand, typically focuses on style or appearance and fails at non-rigid transformations. By explicitly learning the editing transformation from a source-target pair, Edit Transfer mitigates the limitations of both text-only and appearance-centric references. Drawing inspiration from in-context learning in large language models, we propose a visual relation in-context learning paradigm, building upon a DiT-based text-to-image model. We arrange the edited example and the query image into a unified four-panel composite, then apply lightweight LoRA fine-tuning to capture complex spatial transformations from minimal examples. Despite using only 42 training samples, Edit Transfer substantially outperforms state-of-the-art TIE and RIE methods on diverse non-rigid scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of few-shot visual relation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computation Mechanism Behind LLM Position Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13305v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, the manual, knowledge-intensive design process and the lack of high-quality circuit netlists have significantly constrained design space exploration and optimization to behavioral system-level tools. In this work, we introduce LIMCA, a novel fine-tune-free Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework for automating the design and evaluation of IMC crossbar architectures. Unlike traditional approaches, LIMCA employs a No-Human-In-Loop (NHIL) automated pipeline to generate and validate circuit netlists for SPICE simulations, eliminating manual intervention. LIMCA systematically explores the IMC design space by leveraging a structured dataset and LLM-based performance evaluation. Our experimental results on MNIST classification demonstrate that LIMCA successfully generates crossbar designs achieving $\geq$96% accuracy while maintaining a power consumption $\leq$3W, making this the first work in LLM-assisted IMC design space exploration. Compared to existing frameworks, LIMCA provides an automated, scalable, and hardware-aware solution, reducing design exploration time while ensuring user-constrained performance trade-offs.</p></details> | 4 Figures, 5 Tables |

However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.</p></details> | preprint |

The standard approach to instruction alignment has relied on a specific phase of model tuning over curated instruction datasets, optionally complemented with an alignment step over human preferences. Recent work has shown the potential of in-context learning (ICL) alternatives to guide base models towards instruction following. This type of approach is particularly relevant to extend instruction following across languages and models of varying sizes adapted to different types of usage. In this work we compare ICL and instruction fine-tuning in English, French and Spanish, on Small Language Models, and provide experimental results on applying Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) over base models. Our results show that scenarios involving multilingual and smaller models result in downgraded ICL instruction following performance, only partially mitigated by DPO alignment. This study aims to further our understanding of current strengths and limitations of alternative methods for instruction following.</p></details> |  |

We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets, n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022, using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.</p></details> |  |

It addresses a long-standing challenge in automating netlist generation for analog circuits within circuit design automation. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of finetuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. We identify key challenges in this automation and evaluate the multi-modal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, to address these issues. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome current limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach aims to create an end-to-end SPICE netlist generator from circuit schematic images, tackling the long-standing hurdle of accurate netlist generation. Our framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, tested on approximately 2,100 schematics of varying complexity.

The complexity of tabular data, diverse analytical operations, and the demand for high-quality analysis make the process tedious. To address these challenges, we aim to recommend query-code-result triplets tailored for new tables in tabular data analysis workflows. In this paper, we present TablePilot, a pioneering tabular data analysis framework leveraging large language models to autonomously generate comprehensive and superior analytical results without relying on user profiles or prior interactions. The framework incorporates key designs in analysis preparation and analysis optimization to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we propose Rec-Align, a novel method to further improve recommendation quality and better align with human preferences. Experiments on DART, a dataset specifically designed for comprehensive tabular data analysis recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Based on GPT-4o, the tuned TablePilot achieves 77.0% top-5 recommendation recall. Human evaluations further highlight its effectiveness in optimizing tabular data analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphRouter: A Graph-based Router for LLM Selections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03834v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing number and variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges in efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM for a given query, especially considering the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalize across new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leverage contextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their dependence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, which fully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to enhance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneous graph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented as edges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query's requirements and the LLM's capabilities. Through an innovative edge prediction mechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost of LLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations that adapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios have shown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering a minimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhanced generalization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a 9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands. This work endeavors to apply a graph-based approach for the contextual and adaptive selection of LLMs, offering insights for real-world applications.

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can Language Models Follow Multiple Turns of Entangled Instructions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13222v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA.

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture offers a promising solution by dynamically selecting and activating only a subset of experts during inference, thus substantially reducing computational costs while preserving high performance. Despite these benefits, MoE introduces new inefficiencies, such as excessive parameters and communication overhead. In this work, we present a holistic study of compression techniques for Mixture of Experts to enhance both efficiency and scalability. While recent efforts have focused on Expert Trimming, which reduces the number of experts, these approaches still suffer from considerable communication and computational costs. To address this, we propose more aggressive strategies, such as Layer Drop, which removes entire MoE layers, and Block Drop, which eliminates transformer blocks. Surprisingly, these aggressive pruning techniques not only preserve model performance but also substantially improve computation and memory efficiency. Furthermore, beyond Expert Trimming, we also introduce Expert Slimming, which compresses individual experts to further boost performance and can be seamlessly integrated with Expert Trimming. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods-Layer Drop and Block Drop-along with the comprehensive recipe that integrates Expert Slimming and Expert Trimming, achieving a 6.05x speedup with 77.1% reduced memory usage while maintaining over 92% of performance on Mixtral-8x7B. Our code is released at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/Unified-MoE-Compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DAxisPrompt: Promoting the 3D Grounding and Reasoning in GPT-4o](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13185v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant developments in diarization methods, diarization accuracy remains an issue. Here, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for diarization correction as a post-processing step. LLMs were fine-tuned using the Fisher corpus, a large dataset of transcribed conversations. The ability of the models to improve diarization accuracy in a holdout dataset from the Fisher corpus as well as an independent dataset was measured. We report that fine-tuned LLMs can markedly improve diarization accuracy. However, model performance is constrained to transcripts produced using the same ASR tool as the transcripts used for fine-tuning, limiting generalizability. To address this constraint, an ensemble model was developed by combining weights from three separate models, each fine-tuned using transcripts from a different ASR tool. The ensemble model demonstrated better overall performance than each of the ASR-specific models, suggesting that a generalizable and ASR-agnostic approach may be achievable. We have made the weights of these models publicly available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/bklynhlth.</p></details> |  |

An IRT-based Analysis and Alignment Tool for Perceived Socio-Economic Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13149v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based framework to detect and quantify socioeconomic bias in large language models (LLMs) without relying on subjective human judgments. Unlike traditional methods, IRT accounts for item difficulty, improving ideological bias estimation. We fine-tune two LLM families (Meta-LLaMa 3.2-1B-Instruct and Chat- GPT 3.5) to represent distinct ideological positions and introduce a two-stage approach: (1) modeling response avoidance and (2) estimating perceived bias in answered responses. Our results show that off-the-shelf LLMs often avoid ideological engagement rather than exhibit bias, challenging prior claims of partisanship. This empirically validated framework enhances AI alignment research and promotes fairer AI governance.</p></details> |  |

When such systems implement a conversational component to interact with the users, they are also known as conversational agents. Bots, particularly in their conversation-oriented version and AI-powered, have seen their adoption increase over time for software development and engineering purposes. Despite their exciting potential, ulteriorly enhanced by the advent of Generative AI and Large Language Models, bots still need to be improved to develop and integrate into the development cycle since practitioners report that bots add additional challenges that may worsen rather than improve. In this work, we aim to provide a taxonomy for characterizing bots, as well as a series of challenges for their adoption for Software Engineering associated with potential mitigation strategies. To reach our objectives, we conducted a multivocal literature review, reviewing both research and practitioner's literature. Through such an approach, we hope to contribute to both researchers and practitioners by providing first, a series of future research routes to follow, second, a list of strategies to adopt for improving the use of bots for software engineering purposes, and third, enforce a technology and knowledge transfer from the research field to the practitioners one, that is one of the primary goal of multivocal literature reviews.</p></details> |  |

However, this inherent heterogeneity in MLLM model structure and data types makes makeshift extensions to existing LLM training frameworks unsuitable for efficient MLLM training. In this paper, we present Cornstarch, the first general-purpose distributed MLLM training framework. Cornstarch facilitates modular MLLM construction, enables composable parallelization of constituent models, and introduces MLLM-specific optimizations to pipeline and context parallelism for efficient distributed MLLM training. Our evaluation shows that Cornstarch outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to $1.57\times$ in terms of training throughput. Cornstarch is an open-source project available at https://github.com/cornstarch-org/Cornstarch.</p></details> |  |

Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Existing works focus mainly on deductive reasoning tasks (e.g., code and math), while another type of reasoning mode that better aligns with human learning, inductive reasoning, is not well studied. We attribute the reason to the fact that obtaining high-quality process supervision data is challenging for inductive reasoning. Towards this end, we novelly employ number sequences as the source of inductive reasoning data. We package sequences into algorithmic problems to find the general term of each sequence through a code solution. In this way, we can verify whether the code solution holds for any term in the current sequence, and inject case-based supervision signals by using code unit tests. We build a sequence synthetic data pipeline and form a training dataset CodeSeq. Experimental results show that the models tuned with CodeSeq improve on both code and comprehensive reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifting the Veil on Visual Information Flow in MLLMs: Unlocking Pathways to Faster Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13108v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) improve performance on vision-language tasks by integrating visual features from pre-trained vision encoders into large language models (LLMs). However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13107v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning can Help Detect Pretraining Data from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10880v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of large language models (LLMs), detecting pretraining data has been increasingly important due to concerns about fair evaluation and ethical risks. Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing scoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and complexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading to suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we first explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after the release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs shift differently for members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of previously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective method termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation(FSD), which improves the performance of current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we propose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning on a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few unseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a larger deviation distance than members. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, significantly improving the AUC score on common benchmark datasets across various models.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to traditional SSDs, hybrid SSDs also introduce a much larger design space, resulting in higher optimization complexity due to more design factors involved, including flash conversion timing and data migration between different flash cells, etc. To address these challenges, large language models (LLMs) could be a promising technique, as they excel in handling complex, high-dimensional parameter space exploration by leveraging their advanced capability to identify patterns and optimize solutions. Recent works have started exploring the use of LLMs to optimize computer systems. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has focused on optimizing SSDs with the assistance of LLMs. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in understanding and efficiently managing hybrid SSD design space. Specifically, two important questions are exploited and analyzed: 1) Can LLMs offer optimization potential for Hybrid SSD management? 2) How to leverage LLMs for the performance and efficiency of hybrid SSD optimization? Based on the observations of exploration, we propose a comprehensive auto-tuning framework for hybrid SSDs, integrating LLMs to recommend customized configurations using calibration prompts derived from hardware, system, and workload information. Experimental results reveal a 62.35% improvement in throughput and a 57.99% decrease in write amplification compared to the default hybrid SSD configurations achieved with the incorporation of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the use of LLM-as-a-judge has been primarily studied in English. In this paper, we evaluate this framework in Russian by introducing the Russian Error tyPes Annotation dataset (REPA), a dataset of 1k user queries and 2k LLM-generated responses. Human annotators labeled each response pair expressing their preferences across ten specific error types, as well as selecting an overall preference. We rank six generative LLMs across the error types using three rating systems based on human preferences. We also evaluate responses using eight LLM judges in zero-shot and few-shot settings. We describe the results of analyzing the judges and position and length biases. Our findings reveal a notable gap between LLM judge performance in Russian and English. However, rankings based on human and LLM preferences show partial alignment, suggesting that while current LLM judges struggle with fine-grained evaluation in Russian, there is potential for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Identifying Machine vs Human-Generated Text in Hausa](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13101v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has allowed them to be proficient in various tasks, including content generation. However, their unregulated usage can lead to malicious activities such as plagiarism and generating and spreading fake news, especially for low-resource languages. Most existing machine-generated text detectors are trained on high-resource languages like English, French, etc. In this study, we developed the first large-scale detector that can distinguish between human- and machine-generated content in Hausa. We scrapped seven Hausa-language media outlets for the human-generated text and the Gemini-2.0 flash model to automatically generate the corresponding Hausa-language articles based on the human-generated article headlines. We fine-tuned four pre-trained Afri-centric models (AfriTeVa, AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, and AfroXLMR-76L) on the resulting dataset and assessed their performance using accuracy and F1-score metrics. AfroXLMR achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 99.23% and an F1 score of 99.21%, demonstrating its effectiveness for Hausa text detection. Our dataset is made publicly available to enable further research.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing MGT benchmarks include single-author texts (human-written and machine-generated). This conventional design fails to capture more practical multi-author scenarios, where the user refines the LLM response for natural flow, coherence, and factual correctness. Our paper introduces the Benchmark of Expert-edited Machine-generated Outputs (Beemo), which includes 6.5k texts written by humans, generated by ten instruction-finetuned LLMs, and edited by experts for various use cases, ranging from creative writing to summarization. Beemo additionally comprises 13.1k machine-generated and LLM-edited texts, allowing for diverse MGT detection evaluation across various edit types. We document Beemo's creation protocol and present the results of benchmarking 33 configurations of MGT detectors in different experimental setups. We find that expert-based editing evades MGT detection, while LLM-edited texts are unlikely to be recognized as human-written. Beemo and all materials are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

As large language models (LLMs) grow popular in both academia and industry, how to effectively evaluate the capacity of LLMs becomes an increasingly critical but still challenging issue. Existing methods can be divided into two types: manual evaluation, which is expensive, and automatic evaluation, which faces many limitations including task format (the majority belong to multiple-choice questions) and evaluation criteria (occupied by reference-based metrics). To advance the innovation of automatic evaluation, we propose the AEOLLM task which focuses on generative tasks and encourages reference-free methods. Besides, we set up diverse subtasks such as dialogue generation, text expansion, summary generation and non-factoid question answering to comprehensively test different methods. This year, we received 48 runs from 4 teams in total. This paper will describe the background of the task, the data set, the evaluation measures and the evaluation results, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, such as model distillation and transfer learning, often fail to achieve high accuracy. To address this limitation, we introduce the Branch-Merge distillation approach, which enhances model compression through two phases: (1) the Branch Phase, where knowledge from a large teacher model is \textit{selectively distilled} into specialized student models via domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT); And (2) the Merge Phase, where these student models are merged to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve generalization. We validate our distillation approach using DeepSeek-R1 as the teacher and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the student. The resulting merged model, TinyR1-32B-Preview, outperforms its counterpart DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks, including Mathematics (+5.5 points), Coding (+4.4 points) and Science (+2.9 points), while achieving near-equal performance to DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024. The Branch-Merge distillation approach provides a scalable solution for creating smaller, high-performing LLMs with reduced computational cost and time.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</p></details> | work in progress |

Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) (Yao et al., 2022) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing task-oriented dialogue (TOD). We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs severely underperform state-of-the-art approaches on success rate in simulation, this difference becomes less pronounced in human evaluation. Moreover, compared to the baseline, humans report higher subjective satisfaction with ReAct-LLM despite its lower success rate, most likely thanks to its natural and confidently phrased responses.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</p></details> |  |

QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Vision to Language: Text-Free Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction for Enhanced LLMs Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12972v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models.

Despite their strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs remain underutilized for motion sensor data due to the lack of semantic context in time-series, computational constraints, and challenges in processing numerical inputs. SensorLLM addresses these limitations through a Sensor-Language Alignment stage, where we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate textual trend descriptions. This alignment enables LLMs to capture numerical variations, channel-specific features, and data of varying duration--without requiring human annotations. In the subsequent Task-Aware Tuning stage, we refine the model for HAR classification, achieving performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, generalizing across diverse HAR datasets. We believe this work establishes a foundation for future research on time-series and text alignment, paving the way for foundation models in sensor data analysis.</p></details> |  |

The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024), Volume 392, Pages 3179 - 3186, October 2024</p></details> |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaved-Modal Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19488v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to produce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their text-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the original image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal Chain-of-Thought, named \textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)}, which generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and textual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT requires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal content, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the required visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose \textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs. ADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the interleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies solely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and therefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum of VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different architectures. Extensive evaluations of three benchmarks have shown that ICoT prompting achieves substantial performance (up to 14\%) and interpretability improvements compared to existing multimodal CoT prompting methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, it is infeasible to collect all possible instruction datasets simultaneously in real-world scenarios. Thus, enabling MLLM with continual instruction tuning is essential for maintaining their adaptability. However, existing methods often trade off memory efficiency for performance gains, significantly compromising overall efficiency. In this paper, we propose a task-specific expansion and task-general fusion framework based on the variations in Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity across different model layers when trained on diverse datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the information leakage present in the existing benchmark and propose a new and more challenging benchmark to rationally evaluate the performance of different methods. Comprehensive experiments showcase a significant performance improvement of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be public available.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they disrupt the continuity of actions. Meanwhile, some VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions, relying solely on VLM-extracted features, which limits their reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates the strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single large language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the generation gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the diffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe, we find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these two predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and real-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while demonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.</p></details> |  |

Existing defense strategies generally rely on predefined static criteria to differentiate between harmful and benign prompts. However, such rigid rules are incapable of accommodating the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of real jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of ``mirror'' to enable dynamic and adaptive defense. A mirror refers to a dynamically generated prompt that mirrors the syntactic structure of the input while ensuring semantic safety. The personalized discrepancies between the input prompts and their corresponding mirrors serve as the guiding principles for defense. A new defense paradigm, MirrorGuard, is further proposed to detect and calibrate risky inputs based on such mirrors. An entropy-based detection metric, Relative Input Uncertainty (RIU), is integrated into MirrorGuard to quantify the discrepancies between input prompts and mirrors. MirrorGuard is evaluated on several popular datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art defense performance while maintaining general effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Similarity-Driven Weighting by Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12923v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LRL) holds significant potential for addressing sequential tasks, but it still faces considerable challenges. A key difficulty lies in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer while maintaining reliable decision-making performance across subsequent tasks in dynamic environments. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework, SDW (Similarity-Driven Weighting Framework), which leverages large-language-model-generated dynamic functions to precisely control the training process. The core of SDW lies in two functions pre-generated by large models: the task similarity function and the weight computation function. The task similarity function extracts multidimensional features from task descriptions to quantify the similarities and differences between tasks in terms of states, actions, and rewards. The weight computation function dynamically generates critical training parameters based on the similarity information, including the proportion of old task data stored in the Replay Buffer and the strategy consistency weight in the loss function, enabling an adaptive balance between learning new tasks and transferring knowledge from previous tasks. By generating function code offline prior to training, rather than relying on large-model inference during the training process, the SDW framework reduces computational overhead while maintaining efficiency in sequential task scenarios. Experimental results on Atari and MiniHack sequential tasks demonstrate that SDW significantly outperforms existing lifelong reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> |  |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

However, existing research lacks a systematic understanding of the mechanisms underlying how thinking patterns affect performance across model sizes. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of various thinking types on model performance and introduce ThinkPatterns-21k, a curated dataset comprising 21k instruction-response pairs (QA) collected from existing instruction-following datasets with five thinking types. For each pair, we augment it with five distinct internal thinking patterns: one unstructured thinking (monologue) and four structured variants (decomposition, self-ask, self-debate and self-critic), while maintaining the same instruction and response. Through extensive evaluation across different model sizes (3B-32B parameters), we have two key findings: (1) smaller models (<30B parameters) can benefit from most of structured thinking patterns, while larger models (32B) with structured thinking like decomposition would degrade performance and (2) unstructured monologue demonstrates broad effectiveness across different model sizes. Finally, we released all of our datasets, checkpoints, training logs of diverse thinking patterns to reproducibility, aiming to facilitate further research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ARR - February 2025</p></details> |

Human perception is inherently multimodal, relying not only on text but also on auditory and visual cues for a complete understanding of the world. In recognition of this fact, audio-visual LLMs have recently emerged. Despite promising developments, the lack of dedicated benchmarks poses challenges for understanding and evaluating models. In this work, we show that audio-visual LLMs struggle to discern subtle relationships between audio and visual signals, leading to hallucinations and highlighting the need for reliable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce AVHBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the perception and comprehension capabilities of audio-visual LLMs. Our benchmark includes tests for assessing hallucinations, as well as the cross-modal matching and reasoning abilities of these models. Our results reveal that most existing audio-visual LLMs struggle with hallucinations caused by cross-interactions between modalities, due to their limited capacity to perceive complex multimodal signals and their relationships. Additionally, we demonstrate that simple training with our AVHBench improves robustness of audio-visual LLMs against hallucinations.

However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce LR$^2$Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LR$^2$Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR$^2$Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively. These findings underscore the significant room for improvement in the reflective reasoning capabilities of current LLMs. The leaderboard of our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/UltraRonin/LR2Bench</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACL ARR 2025 February</p></details> |

A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, NL2VIS faces challenges in interpreting ambiguous queries, as users often express their visualization needs in imprecise language. To address this challenge, we introduce nvBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to evaluate NL2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0 includes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding visualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a controlled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries through a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed visualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields multiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query traceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths. We evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform ambiguous NL2VIS tasks using nvBench 2.0. We also propose Step-NL2VIS, an LLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous scenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that Step-NL2VIS outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ambiguous NL2VIS tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning.

Current studies typically construct these types of graph separately, overlooking holistic insights and potential unification that could be beneficial in computing resources and usage perspectives. However, a key challenge in developing a unified framework for GKG is obstacles arising from task-specific differences. In this study, we propose a unified framework for constructing generalized knowledge graphs to address this challenge. First, we collect data from 15 sub-tasks in 29 datasets across the three types of graphs, categorizing them into in-sample, counter-task, and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Then, we propose a three-stage curriculum learning fine-tuning framework, by iteratively injecting knowledge from the three types of graphs into the Large Language Models. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model improves the construction of all three graph types across in-domain, OOD and counter-task data.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |

The traditional post-training analysis relies on manually reviewing 2D videos, a time-consuming process that lacks comprehensive situational awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce ACT360, a system that leverages 360-degree videos and machine learning for automated action detection and structured debriefing. ACT360 integrates 360YOWO, an enhanced You Only Watch Once (YOWO) model with spatial attention and equirectangular-aware convolution (EAC) to mitigate panoramic video distortions. To enable deployment in resource-constrained environments, we apply quantization and model pruning, reducing the model size by 74% while maintaining robust accuracy (mAP drop of only 1.5%, from 0.865 to 0.850) and improving inference speed. We validate our approach on a publicly available dataset of 55 labeled 360-degree videos covering seven key operational actions, recorded across various real-world training sessions and environmental conditions. Additionally, ACT360 integrates 360AIE (Action Insight Explorer), a web-based interface for automatic action detection, retrieval, and textual summarization using large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing post-incident analysis efficiency.

| **[Chain-of-Probe: Examining the Necessity and Accuracy of CoT Step-by-Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16144v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research found the issue of Early Answering in large language models (LLMs), where the models already have an answer before generating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process. To this end, we propose a strategic approach based on CoP to prioritize answers with correct reasoning among multiple candidates, thereby bolstering the reliability of the model's reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[ToolFlow: Boosting LLM Tool-Calling Through Natural and Coherent Dialogue Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18447v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common method to enhance the tool calling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with the training data often being synthesized. The current data synthesis process generally involves sampling a set of tools, formulating a requirement based on these tools, and generating the call statements. However, tools sampled randomly lack relevance, making them difficult to combine and thus reducing the diversity of the data. Additionally, current work overlooks the coherence between turns of dialogues, leading to a gap between the synthesized data and real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Graph-based Sampling strategy to sample more relevant tool combinations, and a Planned-generation strategy to create plans that guide the synthesis of coherent dialogues. We integrate these two strategies and enable multiple agents to synthesize the dialogue data interactively, resulting in our tool-calling data synthesis pipeline ToolFlow. Data quality assessments demonstrate improvements in the naturalness and coherence of our synthesized dialogues. Finally, we apply SFT on LLaMA-3.1-8B using 8,000 synthetic dialogues generated with ToolFlow. Results show that the model achieves tool-calling performance comparable to or even surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising opportunities for BLV assistance, their development has been hindered by limited datasets. This limitation stems from the fact that BLV-aware annotation requires specialized domain knowledge and intensive labor. To address this gap, we introduce GuideDog, a novel accessibility-aware guide dataset containing 22K image-description pairs (including 2K human-annotated pairs) that capture diverse real-world scenes from a pedestrian's viewpoint. Our approach shifts the annotation burden from generation to verification through a collaborative human-AI framework grounded in established accessibility standards, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high-quality annotations. We also develop GuideDogQA, a subset of 818 samples featuring multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate fine-grained visual perception capabilities, specifically object recognition and relative depth perception. Our experimental results highlight the importance of accurate spatial understanding for effective BLV guidance. GuideDog and GuideDogQA will advance research in MLLM-based assistive technologies for BLV individuals while contributing to broader applications in understanding egocentric scenes for robotics and augmented reality. The code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly focus on utilizing LLMs to solve optimization problems in a prompt-based manner, which takes observational feedback as additional textual descriptions. However, due to LLM's \textbf{high sensitivity to the prompts} and \textbf{tendency to get lost in lengthy prompts}, these methods struggle to effectively utilize the {observational} feedback from each optimization step, which severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptually simple and general {bi-level} optimization method, namely \textbf{G}eneral \textbf{S}cientific \textbf{O}ptimizers (GSO). Specifically, GSO first utilizes inner-level simulators as experimental platforms to evaluate the current solution and provide observational feedback. Then, LLMs serve as knowledgeable and versatile scientists, generating new solutions by refining potential errors from the feedback as the outer-level optimization. Finally, simulations together with the expert knowledge in LLMs are jointly updated with bi-level interactions via model editing. Extensive experiments show that GSO consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods using \textit{six} different LLM backbones on \textit{seven} different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Trust or Not to Trust? Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14675v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model's internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-assess the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Power Law for Loss Curve Prediction Across Learning Rate Schedules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12811v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large models is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to understand the quantitative relationship between model performance and hyperparameters. In this paper, we present an empirical law that describes how the pretraining loss of large language models evolves under different learning rate schedules, such as constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate this law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration. Our project is available at https://github.com/xiaomi-research/r1-aqa and https://huggingface.co/mispeech/r1-aqa.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Learning With Sine-Activated Low-rank Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19243v5)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Grounded Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12799v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite great progress, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to visual hallucination, greatly impeding their trustworthy applications. In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepPerception: Advancing R1-like Cognitive Visual Perception in MLLMs for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12797v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

| **[Quantum-Enhanced LLM Efficient Fine Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12790v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models via low-rank matrix approximation, which is effective in many scenarios. However, its low-rank representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. Addressing the expressive bottleneck of classical low-rank approximation in fine-tuning large language models, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on a Quantum Weighted Tensor Hybrid Network (QWTHN), which leverages Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The study investigates quantum-classical hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning in low-rank spaces. QWTHN decomposes pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, utilizing quantum state superposition and other methods to break through classical rank limitations. Experiments show that the proposed quantum fine-tuning technique for large models approaches or even surpasses the parameter efficiency of LoRA. On the CPsyCounD and R1-Distill-SFT datasets, QWTHN, compared to classical LoRA, reduces training loss by up to 15% while using 76% fewer parameters, and achieves an 8.4% performance improvement on the CPsyCounD test set. This research not only realizes lightweight and efficient adaptation of quantum resources to billion-parameter models but also validates the practical path of quantum hardware driven by large model tasks, laying the first engineering-ready technical foundation for future quantum-enhanced AGI systems.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at https://github.com/sungyeonparkk/NuPlanQA.</p></details> |  |

(2023) [01], the large language model GPT demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference), decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across various scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on conflict resolution theory, we introduce a user-centered workflow for multi-user personalization comprising three stages: Reflection, Analysis, and Feedback. We then present MAP -- a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent system for multi-user \textbf{P}ersonalization -- to operationalize this workflow. By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems to implement user-centered, multi-user personalization workflows and concludes by offering insights for personalization in multi-user contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ex...</summary><p>In Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Consistency of Video Large Language Models in Temporal Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12951v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (Video-LLMs) can temporally ground language queries and retrieve video moments. Yet, such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content, we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents, language queries, and task settings, unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency. We further explore common prompting and instruction-tuning methods as potential solutions, but find that their improvements are often unstable. To that end, we propose event temporal verification tuning that explicitly accounts for consistency, and demonstrate significant improvements for both grounding and consistency. Our data and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/minjoong507/Consistency-of-Video-LLM.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR'25 |

Our implementation is designed to be useful in practice for working mathematicians; it does not require expertise in machine learning or access to high-performance computing resources. Applying {\it funsearch} to a new problem involves modifying a small segment of Python code and selecting a large language model (LLM) from one of many third-party providers. We benchmarked our implementation on three different problems, obtaining metrics that may inform applications of {\it funsearch} to new problems. Our results demonstrate that {\it funsearch} successfully learns in a variety of combinatorial and number-theoretic settings, and in some contexts learns principles that generalize beyond the problem originally trained on.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

An Agentic HLS Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12721v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization.
