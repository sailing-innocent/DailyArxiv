| **[ATLAS Navigator: Active Task-driven LAnguage-embedded Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20386v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of task-oriented navigation in unstructured and unknown environments, where robots must incrementally build and reason on rich, metric-semantic maps in real time. Since tasks may require clarification or re-specification, it is necessary for the information in the map to be rich enough to enable generalization across a wide range of tasks. To effectively execute tasks specified in natural language, we propose a hierarchical representation built on language-embedded Gaussian splatting that enables both sparse semantic planning that lends itself to online operation and dense geometric representation for collision-free navigation. We validate the effectiveness of our method through real-world robot experiments conducted in both cluttered indoor and kilometer-scale outdoor environments, with a competitive ratio of about 60% against privileged baselines.

| **[Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06838v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniGS: Unified Language-Image-3D Pretraining with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17860v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multi-modal 3D pre-training methods have shown promising efficacy in learning joint representations of text, images, and point clouds. However, adopting point clouds as 3D representation fails to fully capture the intricacies of the 3D world and exhibits a noticeable gap between the discrete points and the dense 2D pixels of images. To tackle this issue, we propose UniGS, integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into multi-modal pre-training to enhance the 3D representation. We first rely on the 3DGS representation to model the 3D world as a collection of 3D Gaussians with color and opacity, incorporating all the information of the 3D scene while establishing a strong connection with 2D images. Then, to achieve Language-Image-3D pertaining, UniGS starts with a pre-trained vision-language model to establish a shared visual and textual space through extensive real-world image-text pairs. Subsequently, UniGS employs a 3D encoder to align the optimized 3DGS with the Language-Image representations to learn unified multi-modal representations. To facilitate the extraction of global explicit 3D features by the 3D encoder and achieve better cross-modal alignment, we additionally introduce a novel Gaussian-Aware Guidance module that guides the learning of fine-grained representations of the 3D domain. Through extensive experiments across the Objaverse, ABO, MVImgNet and SUN RGBD datasets with zero-shot classification, text-driven retrieval and open-world understanding tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGS in learning a more general and stronger aligned multi-modal representation. Specifically, UniGS achieves leading results across different 3D tasks with remarkable improvements over previous SOTA, Uni3D, including on zero-shot classification (+9.36%), text-driven retrieval (+4.3%) and open-world understanding (+7.92%).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; Corrected citation of Uni3D;</p></details> |
| **[No Parameters, No Problem: 3D Gaussian Splatting without Camera Intrinsics and Extrinsics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19800v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made significant progress in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it still heavily relies on accurately pre-computed camera intrinsics and extrinsics, such as focal length and camera poses. In order to mitigate this dependency, the previous efforts have focused on optimizing 3DGS without the need for camera poses, yet camera intrinsics remain necessary. To further loose the requirement, we propose a joint optimization method to train 3DGS from an image collection without requiring either camera intrinsics or extrinsics. To achieve this goal, we introduce several key improvements during the joint training of 3DGS. We theoretically derive the gradient of the camera intrinsics, allowing the camera intrinsics to be optimized simultaneously during training. Moreover, we integrate global track information and select the Gaussian kernels associated with each track, which will be trained and automatically rescaled to an infinitesimally small size, closely approximating surface points, and focusing on enforcing multi-view consistency and minimizing reprojection errors, while the remaining kernels continue to serve their original roles. This hybrid training strategy nicely unifies the camera parameters estimation and 3DGS training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both public and synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Semantic Part Segmentation of 3D Human](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19782v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D part segmentation is still an open problem in the field of 3D vision and AR/VR. Due to limited 3D labeled data, traditional supervised segmentation methods fall short in generalizing to unseen shapes and categories. Recently, the advancement in vision-language models' zero-shot abilities has brought a surge in open-world 3D segmentation methods. While these methods show promising results for 3D scenes or objects, they do not generalize well to 3D humans. In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary segmentation method capable of handling 3D human. Our framework can segment the human category into desired fine-grained parts based on the textual prompt. We design a simple segmentation pipeline, leveraging SAM to generate multi-view proposals in 2D and proposing a novel HumanCLIP model to create unified embeddings for visual and textual inputs. Compared with existing pre-trained CLIP models, the HumanCLIP model yields more accurate embeddings for human-centric contents. We also design a simple-yet-effective MaskFusion module, which classifies and fuses multi-view features into 3D semantic masks without complex voting and grouping mechanisms. The design of decoupling mask proposals and text input also significantly boosts the efficiency of per-prompt inference. Experimental results on various 3D human datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods by a large margin. In addition, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including meshes, point clouds, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |
| **[Generative Gaussian Splatting for Unbounded 3D City Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06526v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D city generation with NeRF-based methods shows promising generation results but is computationally inefficient. Recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a highly efficient alternative for object-level 3D generation. However, adapting 3D-GS from finite-scale 3D objects and humans to infinite-scale 3D cities is non-trivial. Unbounded 3D city generation entails significant storage overhead (out-of-memory issues), arising from the need to expand points to billions, often demanding hundreds of Gigabytes of VRAM for a city scene spanning 10km^2. In this paper, we propose GaussianCity, a generative Gaussian Splatting framework dedicated to efficiently synthesizing unbounded 3D cities with a single feed-forward pass. Our key insights are two-fold: 1) Compact 3D Scene Representation: We introduce BEV-Point as a highly compact intermediate representation, ensuring that the growth in VRAM usage for unbounded scenes remains constant, thus enabling unbounded city generation. 2) Spatial-aware Gaussian Attribute Decoder: We present spatial-aware BEV-Point decoder to produce 3D Gaussian attributes, which leverages Point Serializer to integrate the structural and contextual characteristics of BEV points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaussianCity achieves state-of-the-art results in both drone-view and street-view 3D city generation. Notably, compared to CityDreamer, GaussianCity exhibits superior performance with a speedup of 60 times (10.72 FPS v.s. 0.18 FPS).</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[HybridGS: Decoupling Transients and Statics with 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03844v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality novel view renderings of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in scenes featuring transient objects is challenging. We propose a novel hybrid representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes. Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency, making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis across various settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our state-of-the-art performance of novel view synthesis in both indoor and outdoor scenes, even in the presence of distracting elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by CVPR 2025.

| **[GStex: Per-Primitive Texturing of 2D Gaussian Splatting for Decoupled Appearance and Geometry Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12954v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian splatting has demonstrated excellent performance for view synthesis and scene reconstruction. The representation achieves photorealistic quality by optimizing the position, scale, color, and opacity of thousands to millions of 2D or 3D Gaussian primitives within a scene. However, since each Gaussian primitive encodes both appearance and geometry, these attributes are strongly coupled--thus, high-fidelity appearance modeling requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, even when the scene geometry is simple (e.g., for a textured planar surface). We propose to texture each 2D Gaussian primitive so that even a single Gaussian can be used to capture appearance details. By employing per-primitive texturing, our appearance representation is agnostic to the topology and complexity of the scene's geometry. We show that our approach, GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian splats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our decoupling enables improved novel view synthesis performance compared to 2D Gaussian splatting when reducing the number of Gaussian primitives, and that GStex can be used for scene appearance editing and re-texturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lessvrong.com/cs/gstex.

| **[Does 3D Gaussian Splatting Need Accurate Volumetric Rendering?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19318v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become an important reference method for learning 3D representations of a captured scene, allowing real-time novel-view synthesis with high visual quality and fast training times. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which preceded 3DGS, are based on a principled ray-marching approach for volumetric rendering. In contrast, while sharing a similar image formation model with NeRF, 3DGS uses a hybrid rendering solution that builds on the strengths of volume rendering and primitive rasterization. A crucial benefit of 3DGS is its performance, achieved through a set of approximations, in many cases with respect to volumetric rendering theory. A naturally arising question is whether replacing these approximations with more principled volumetric rendering solutions can improve the quality of 3DGS. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the various approximations and assumptions used by the original 3DGS solution. We demonstrate that, while more accurate volumetric rendering can help for low numbers of primitives, the power of efficient optimization and the large number of Gaussians allows 3DGS to outperform volumetric rendering despite its approximations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Eurogrpahics 2025, code: https://github.com/cg-tuwien/does_3d_gaussian_splatting_need_accurate_volumetric_rendering</p></details> |
| **[Building Interactable Replicas of Complex Articulated Objects via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19459v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building articulated objects is a key challenge in computer vision. Existing methods often fail to effectively integrate information across different object states, limiting the accuracy of part-mesh reconstruction and part dynamics modeling, particularly for complex multi-part articulated objects. We introduce ArtGS, a novel approach that leverages 3D Gaussians as a flexible and efficient representation to address these issues. Our method incorporates canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization and updates for aligning articulated part information across different object states, and employs a skinning-inspired part dynamics modeling module to improve both part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a new benchmark for complex multi-part objects, demonstrate that ArtGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction. Our approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and efficiency, especially for multi-part articulated objects. Additionally, we provide comprehensive analyses of our design choices, validating the effectiveness of each component to highlight potential areas for future improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compression in 3D Gaussian Splatting: A Survey of Methods, Trends, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19457v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a pioneering approach in explicit scene rendering and computer graphics. Unlike traditional neural radiance field (NeRF) methods, which typically rely on implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values, 3DGS utilizes millions of learnable 3D Gaussians. Its differentiable rendering technique and inherent capability for explicit scene representation and manipulation positions 3DGS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation technologies. This enables 3DGS to deliver real-time rendering speeds while offering unparalleled editability levels. However, despite its advantages, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory and storage requirements, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview focusing on the scalability and compression of 3DGS. We begin with a detailed background overview of 3DGS, followed by a structured taxonomy of existing compression methods. Additionally, we analyze and compare current methods from the topological perspective, evaluating their strengths and limitations in terms of fidelity, compression ratios, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore how advancements in efficient NeRF representations can inspire future developments in 3DGS optimization. Finally, we conclude with current research challenges and highlight key directions for future exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaffold-SLAM: Structured 3D Gaussians for Simultaneous Localization and Photorealistic Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05242v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing SLAM methods utilizing 3DGS have failed to provide high-quality novel view rendering for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras simultaneously. Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianFlowOcc: Sparse and Weakly Supervised Occupancy Estimation using Gaussian Splatting and Temporal Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Guided Scene Reconstruction from Images with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17377v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates an open research challenge of reconstructing high-quality, large 3D open scenes from images. It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets.

| **[Laplace-Beltrami Operator for Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17531v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rising popularity of 3D Gaussian splatting and the expanse of applications from rendering to 3D reconstruction, there comes also a need for geometry processing applications directly on this new representation. While considering the centers of Gaussians as a point cloud or meshing them is an option that allows to apply existing algorithms, this might ignore information present in the data or be unnecessarily expensive. Additionally, Gaussian splatting tends to contain a large number of outliers which do not affect the rendering quality but need to be handled correctly in order not to produce noisy results in geometry processing applications. In this work, we propose a formulation to compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a widely used tool in geometry processing, directly on Gaussian splatting using the Mahalanobis distance. While conceptually similar to a point cloud Laplacian, our experiments show superior accuracy on the point clouds encoded in the Gaussian splatting centers and, additionally, the operator can be used to evaluate the quality of the output during optimization.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, prior work has primarily focused on evaluating its performance through software-based rendering on programmable shader cores, leaving its performance when exploiting fixed-function graphics units largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the performance implications of performing radiance field rendering on the hardware graphics pipeline. In doing so, we implement the state-of-the-art radiance field method, 3D Gaussian splatting, using graphics APIs and evaluate it across synthetic and real-world scenes on today's graphics hardware. Based on our analysis, we present VR-Pipe, which seamlessly integrates two innovations into graphics hardware to streamline the hardware pipeline for volume rendering, such as radiance field methods. First, we introduce native hardware support for early termination by repurposing existing special-purpose hardware in modern GPUs. Second, we propose multi-granular tile binning with quad merging, which opportunistically blends fragments in shader cores before passing them to fixed-function blending units. Our evaluation shows that VR-Pipe greatly improves rendering performance, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup over the conventional graphics pipeline with negligible hardware overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 31st International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2025)</p></details> |

Recent works typically struggle to effectively understand and adapt to dynamic environments due to the inability to update their environment representations in memory according to environment changes and lack of fine-grained reconstruction of the environments. To address these challenges, we propose DynamicGSG, a dynamic, high-fidelity, open-vocabulary scene graph construction system leveraging Gaussian splatting. DynamicGSG builds hierarchical scene graphs using advanced vision language models to represent the spatial and semantic relationships between objects in the environments, utilizes a joint feature loss we designed to supervise Gaussian instance grouping while optimizing the Gaussian maps, and locally updates the Gaussian scene graphs according to real environment changes for long-term environment adaptation. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the performance and efficacy of our proposed method in terms of semantic segmentation, language-guided object retrieval, and reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we validate the dynamic updating capabilities of our system in real laboratory environments. The source code and supplementary experimental materials will be released at:~\href{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/Dynamic-GSG}{https://github.com/GeLuzhou/Dynamic-GSG}.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dr. Splat: Directly Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting via Direct Language Embedding Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16652v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Dr. Splat, a novel approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike existing language-embedded 3DGS methods, which rely on a rendering process, our method directly associates language-aligned CLIP embeddings with 3D Gaussians for holistic 3D scene understanding. The key of our method is a language feature registration technique where CLIP embeddings are assigned to the dominant Gaussians intersected by each pixel-ray. Moreover, we integrate Product Quantization (PQ) trained on general large-scale image data to compactly represent embeddings without per-scene optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches in 3D perception benchmarks, such as open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, 3D object localization, and 3D object selection tasks.

| **[Dragen3D: Multiview Geometry Consistent 3D Gaussian Generation with Drag-Based Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16475v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-image 3D generation has emerged as a prominent research topic, playing a vital role in virtual reality, 3D modeling, and digital content creation. However, existing methods face challenges such as a lack of multi-view geometric consistency and limited controllability during the generation process, which significantly restrict their usability. % To tackle these challenges, we introduce Dragen3D, a novel approach that achieves geometrically consistent and controllable 3D generation leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We introduce the Anchor-Gaussian Variational Autoencoder (Anchor-GS VAE), which encodes a point cloud and a single image into anchor latents and decode these latents into 3DGS, enabling efficient latent-space generation. To enable multi-view geometry consistent and controllable generation, we propose a Seed-Point-Driven strategy: first generate sparse seed points as a coarse geometry representation, then map them to anchor latents via the Seed-Anchor Mapping Module. Geometric consistency is ensured by the easily learned sparse seed points, and users can intuitively drag the seed points to deform the final 3DGS geometry, with changes propagated through the anchor latents.

However, existing approaches encounter challenges, including sensitivity to artifacts and noise, suboptimal selection of training viewpoints, and the absence of global optimization. In this paper, we propose GSORB-SLAM, a dense SLAM framework that integrates 3DGS with ORB features through a tightly coupled optimization pipeline. To mitigate the effects of noise and artifacts, we propose a novel geometric representation and optimization method for tracking, which significantly enhances localization accuracy and robustness. For high-fidelity mapping, we develop an adaptive Gaussian expansion and regularization method that facilitates compact yet expressive scene modeling while suppressing redundant primitives. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph-based viewpoint selection mechanism that effectively reduces overfitting and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tracking precision-improving RMSE by 16.2% compared to ORB-SLAM2 baselines-and reconstruction quality-improving PSNR by 3.93 dB compared to 3DGS-SLAM baselines.

However, recent Sim2real methods either rely on a large amount of augmented data or large learning models, which is inefficient for specific tasks. In recent years, with the emergence of radiance field reconstruction methods, especially 3D Gaussian splatting, it has become possible to construct realistic real-world scenes. To this end, we propose RL-GSBridge, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework which incorporates 3D Gaussian Splatting into the conventional RL simulation pipeline, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for vision-based deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a mesh-based 3D GS method with soft binding constraints, enhancing the rendering quality of mesh models. Then utilizing a GS editing approach to synchronize the rendering with the physics simulator, RL-GSBridge could reflect the visual interactions of the physical robot accurately. Through a series of sim-to-real experiments, including grasping and pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that RL-GSBridge maintains a satisfactory success rate in real-world task completion during sim-to-real transfer. Furthermore, a series of rendering metrics and visualization results indicate that our proposed mesh-based 3D GS reduces artifacts in unstructured objects, demonstrating more realistic rendering performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

However, 3DGS fails to accurately represent surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistent nature of 3D Gaussians. We present 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), a novel approach to model and reconstruct geometrically accurate radiance fields from multi-view images. Our key idea is to collapse the 3D volume into a set of 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks. Unlike 3D Gaussians, 2D Gaussians provide view-consistent geometry while modeling surfaces intrinsically. To accurately recover thin surfaces and achieve stable optimization, we introduce a perspective-correct 2D splatting process utilizing ray-splat intersection and rasterization. Additionally, we incorporate depth distortion and normal consistency terms to further enhance the quality of the reconstructions. We demonstrate that our differentiable renderer allows for noise-free and detailed geometry reconstruction while maintaining competitive appearance quality, fast training speed, and real-time rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures.

We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility.

However, previous GS-based methods primarily target indoor scenes and rely on RGB-D sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, hence underperforming in outdoor scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a RGB-only gaussian splatting SLAM method for unbounded outdoor scenes--OpenGS-SLAM. Technically, we first employ a pointmap regression network to generate consistent pointmaps between frames for pose estimation. Compared to commonly used depth maps, pointmaps include spatial relationships and scene geometry across multiple views, enabling robust camera pose estimation. Then, we propose integrating the estimated camera poses with 3DGS rendering as an end-to-end differentiable pipeline. Our method achieves simultaneous optimization of camera poses and 3DGS scene parameters, significantly enhancing system tracking accuracy. Specifically, we also design an adaptive scale mapper for the pointmap regression network, which provides more accurate pointmap mapping to the 3DGS map representation. Our experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that OpenGS-SLAM reduces tracking error to 9.8\% of previous 3DGS methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis.

However, processes for supporting end-user hardware troubleshooting or routine maintenance aren't well defined. As a result, providing technical support for hardware remains ad-hoc and challenging to scale. Inspired by patterns that helped scale software troubleshooting, we propose a workflow for asynchronous hardware troubleshooting: SplatOverflow. SplatOverflow creates a novel boundary object, the SplatOverflow scene, that users reference to communicate about hardware. A scene comprises a 3D Gaussian Splat of the user's hardware registered onto the hardware's CAD model. The splat captures the current state of the hardware, and the registered CAD model acts as a referential anchor for troubleshooting instructions. With SplatOverflow, remote maintainers can directly address issues and author instructions in the user's workspace. Workflows containing multiple instructions can easily be shared between users and recontextualized in new environments. In this paper, we describe the design of SplatOverflow, the workflows it enables, and its utility to different kinds of users. We also validate that non-experts can use SplatOverflow to troubleshoot common problems with a 3D printer in a usability study.

However, its geometric accuracy in 3D reconstruction remains limited due to the lack of explicit geometric constraints during optimization. This paper introduces CDGS, a confidence-aware depth regularization approach developed to enhance 3DGS. We leverage multi-cue confidence maps of monocular depth estimation and sparse Structure-from-Motion depth to adaptively adjust depth supervision during the optimization process. Our method demonstrates improved geometric detail preservation in early training stages and achieves competitive performance in both NVS quality and geometric accuracy. Experiments on the publicly available Tanks and Temples benchmark dataset show that our method achieves more stable convergence behavior and more accurate geometric reconstruction results, with improvements of up to 2.31 dB in PSNR for NVS and consistently lower geometric errors in M3C2 distance metrics. Notably, our method reaches comparable F-scores to the original 3DGS with only 50% of the training iterations. We expect this work will facilitate the development of efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction systems for real-world applications such as digital twin creation, heritage preservation, or forestry applications.</p></details> |  |

With advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), previous studies have applied it to reconstruct complex dynamic driving scenes. These methods typically require expensive LiDAR sensors and pre-annotated datasets of dynamic objects. To address these challenges, we propose OG-Gaussian, a novel approach that replaces LiDAR point clouds with Occupancy Grids (OGs) generated from surround-view camera images using Occupancy Prediction Network (ONet). Our method leverages the semantic information in OGs to separate dynamic vehicles from static street background, converting these grids into two distinct sets of initial point clouds for reconstructing both static and dynamic objects. Additionally, we estimate the trajectories and poses of dynamic objects through a learning-based approach, eliminating the need for complex manual annotations. Experiments on Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that OG-Gaussian is on par with the current state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction quality and rendering speed, achieving an average PSNR of 35.13 and a rendering speed of 143 FPS, while significantly reducing computational costs and economic overhead.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition. We study two variants of 3D-Adapter: a fast feed-forward version based on Gaussian splatting and a versatile training-free version utilizing neural fields and meshes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D-Adapter not only greatly enhances the geometry quality of text-to-multi-view models such as Instant3D and Zero123++, but also enables high-quality 3D generation using the plain text-to-image Stable Diffusion.

Although neural reconstruction approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable capabilities, their processing costs remain substantial. Recently, the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) largely improves the training efficiency and facilitates to generate realistic rendering in real-time. However, due to the limited ability of Spherical Harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information, 3D-GS falls short in reconstructing glossy objects. Researchers have turned to enhance the specular expressiveness of 3D-GS through inverse rendering. Yet these methods often struggle to maintain the training and rendering efficiency, undermining the benefits of Gaussian Splatting techniques. In this paper, we introduce GlossGau, an efficient inverse rendering framework that reconstructs scenes with glossy surfaces while maintaining training and rendering speeds comparable to vanilla 3D-GS. Specifically, we explicitly model the surface normals, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters, as well as incident lights and use Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) to approximate the per-Gaussian Normal Distribution Function under the microfacet model. We utilize 2D Gaussian Splatting (2D-GS) as foundational primitives and apply regularization to significantly alleviate the normal estimation challenge encountered in related works. Experiments demonstrate that GlossGau achieves competitive or superior reconstruction on datasets with glossy surfaces. Compared with previous GS-based works that address the specular surface, our optimization time is considerably less.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this limitation, we propose Inter3D, a new benchmark and approach for novel state synthesis of human-interactive objects. We introduce a self-collected dataset featuring commonly encountered interactive objects and a new evaluation pipeline, where only individual part states are observed during training, while part combination states remain unseen. We also propose a strong baseline approach that leverages Space Discrepancy Tensors to efficiently modelling all states of an object. To alleviate the impractical constraints on camera trajectories across training states, we propose a Mutual State Regularization mechanism to enhance the spatial density consistency of movable parts.

First, we propose a hybrid explicit representation that combines the advantages of two primitive-based efficient rendering techniques. UV-mapped 3D mesh is utilized to capture sharp and rich textures on smooth surfaces, while 3D Gaussian Splatting is employed to represent complex geometric structures. In the pipeline of modeling an avatar, after tracking parametric models based on captured multi-view RGB videos, our goal is to simultaneously optimize the texture and opacity map of mesh, as well as a set of 3D Gaussian splats localized and rigged onto the mesh facets. Specifically, we perform $\alpha$-blending on the color and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffer from the rasterization results of mesh and 3DGS. This process involves the mesh and 3DGS adaptively fitting the captured visual information to outline a high-fidelity digital avatar. To avoid artifacts caused by Gaussian splats crossing the mesh facets, we design a stable hybrid depth sorting strategy.

To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning.

Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral paper at ICLR 2025.

But understanding physical properties like mass, friction, and hardness, in the wild, remains challenging. We propose a new method that reconstructs 3D objects using the Gaussian splatting representation and predicts various physical properties in a zero-shot manner. We propose two techniques during the reconstruction phase: a geometry-aware regularization loss function to improve the shape quality and a region-aware feature contrastive loss function to promote region affinity. Two other new techniques are designed during inference: a feature-based property propagation module and a volume integration module tailored for the Gaussian representation. Our framework is named as zero-shot physical understanding with Gaussian splatting, or PUGS. PUGS achieves new state-of-the-art results on the standard benchmark of ABO-500 mass prediction. We provide extensive quantitative ablations and qualitative visualization to demonstrate the mechanism of our designs. We show the proposed methodology can help address challenging real-world grasping tasks.

In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

AMD Versal AI Engine is a commercial spatial architecture consisting of tiles of VLIW processors supporting SIMD operations arranged in a two-dimensional mesh. The architecture requires the explicit design of task assignments and dataflow configurations for each tile to maximize performance, demanding advanced techniques and meticulous design. However, a few works revealed the performance characteristics of the Versal AI Engine through practical workloads. In this work, we provide the comprehensive performance evaluation of the Versal AI Engine using Gaussian feature computation in 3D Gaussian splatting as a practical workload, and we then propose a novel dedicated algorithm to fully exploit the hardware architecture. The computations of 3D Gaussian splatting include matrix multiplications and color computations utilizing high-dimensional spherical harmonic coefficients. These tasks are processed efficiently by leveraging the SIMD capabilities and their instruction-level parallelism. Additionally, pipelined processing is achieved by assigning different tasks to individual cores, thereby fully exploiting the spatial parallelism of AI Engines. The proposed method demonstrated a 226-fold throughput increase in simulation-based evaluation, outperforming a naive approach. These findings provide valuable insights for application development that effectively harnesses the spatial and architectural advantages of AI Engines.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://denghilbert.github.io/self-cali/</p></details> |

Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images</p></details> |  |

In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment.</p></details> |  |

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs</p></details> |

GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</p></details> |  |

The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

| **[PoI: Pixel of Interest for Novel View Synthesis Assisted Scene Coordinate Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04843v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[BillBoard Splatting (BBSplat): Learnable Textured Primitives for Novel View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08508v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present billboard Splatting (BBSplat) - a novel approach for 3D scene representation based on textured geometric primitives. BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), preserving the accurate mesh extraction ability of 2D primitives. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11394v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in incomplete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transparent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation. First, we examine recent works in incorporating physical priors into static and dynamic 3D generation, categorizing methods based on representation types, including vision-based, NeRF-based, and Gaussian Splatting-based approaches. Second, we explore emerging techniques in 4D generation, focusing on methods that model temporal dynamics with physical simulations. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of major methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different materials and motion dynamics. By presenting an in-depth analysis of physics-grounded AIGC, this survey aims to bridge the gap between generative models and physical realism, providing insights that inspire future research in physically consistent content generation.</p></details> |  |

To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |

Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement.

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 14 pages,11 figures |

This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods. As one of the first methods addressing promptable segmentation in 3D-GS, the simplicity and effectiveness of SAGA pave the way for future advancements in this field. Our code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25. Project page: https://jumpat.github.io/SAGA</p></details> |

This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.

| **[GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11625v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

| **[LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</p></details> |  |

An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io/</p></details> |

With the proliferation of NeRF-based creations, the need for copyright protection has emerged as a critical issue. Although some approaches have been proposed to embed digital watermarks into NeRF, they often neglect essential model-level considerations and incur substantial time overheads, resulting in reduced imperceptibility and robustness, along with user inconvenience. In this paper, we extend the previous criteria for image watermarking to the model level and propose NeRF Signature, a novel watermarking method for NeRF. We employ a Codebook-aided Signature Embedding (CSE) that does not alter the model structure, thereby maintaining imperceptibility and enhancing robustness at the model level. Furthermore, after optimization, any desired signatures can be embedded through the CSE, and no fine-tuning is required when NeRF owners want to use new binary signatures. Then, we introduce a joint pose-patch encryption watermarking strategy to hide signatures into patches rendered from a specific viewpoint for higher robustness. In addition, we explore a Complexity-Aware Key Selection (CAKS) scheme to embed signatures in high visual complexity patches to enhance imperceptibility. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.

Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We experimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved quality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and rendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

This study addresses the challenge of visualizing objects within large-scale scenes at a high level of detail (LOD) using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The aim is to improve the visual fidelity of chosen objects while maintaining the efficiency of the computations by focusing on details only for relevant content. The proposed ROI-NeRFs framework divides the scene into a Scene NeRF, which represents the overall scene at moderate detail, and multiple ROI NeRFs that focus on user-defined objects of interest. An object-focused camera selection module automatically groups relevant cameras for each NeRF training during the decomposition phase. In the composition phase, a Ray-level Compositional Rendering technique combines information from the Scene NeRF and ROI NeRFs, allowing simultaneous multi-object rendering composition. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, including one on a complex eighteen's century cultural heritage room, demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods, improving LOD for object regions, minimizing artifacts, and without significantly increasing inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including appendix, 16 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces IOVS4NeRF, a framework that employs an uncertainty-guided incremental optimal view selection strategy adaptable to various NeRF implementations. Specifically, by leveraging a hybrid uncertainty model that combines rendering and positional uncertainties, the proposed method calculates the most informative view from among the candidates, thereby enabling incremental optimization of scene reconstruction. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that IOVS4NeRF achieves high-fidelity NeRF reconstruction with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale scene applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embed Any NeRF: Graph Meta-Networks for Neural Tasks on Arbitrary NeRF Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09623v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm for representing 3D objects and scenes by encoding shape and appearance information into the weights of a neural network. Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.</p></details> | Under review |

In recent years, 3D object generation has made great process and achieved promising results, but it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generating complex, textured, and high-fidelity results. To resolve this problem, we study learning effective NeRFs and SDFs representations with 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D object generation. Specifically, inspired by recent works, we use the efficient geometry-aware 3D GANs as the backbone incorporating with label embedding and color mapping, which enables to train the model on different taxonomies simultaneously. Then, through a decoder, we aggregate the resulting features to generate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) based representations for rendering high-fidelity synthetic images. Meanwhile, we optimize Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to effectively represent objects with 3D meshes. Besides, we observe that this model can be effectively trained with only a few images of each object from a variety of classes, instead of using a great number of images per object or training one model per class. With this pipeline, we can optimize an effective model for 3D object generation. This solution is among the top 3 in the ICCV 2023 OmniObject3D Challenge.</p></details> |  |

Especially, we argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UV-Attack: Physical-World Adversarial Attacks for Person Detection via Dynamic-NeRF-based UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05783v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, submitted to ICLR2025</p></details> |
| **[EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041v4)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRFs are Mirror Detectors: Using Structural Similarity for Multi-View Mirror Scene Reconstruction with 3D Surface Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04074v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While neural radiance fields (NeRF) led to a breakthrough in photorealistic novel view synthesis, handling mirroring surfaces still denotes a particular challenge as they introduce severe inconsistencies in the scene representation. Previous attempts either focus on reconstructing single reflective objects or rely on strong supervision guidance in terms of additional user-provided annotations of visible image regions of the mirrors, thereby limiting the practical usability. In contrast, in this paper, we present NeRF-MD, a method which shows that NeRFs can be considered as mirror detectors and which is capable of reconstructing neural radiance fields of scenes containing mirroring surfaces without the need for prior annotations. To this end, we first compute an initial estimate of the scene geometry by training a standard NeRF using a depth reprojection loss. Our key insight lies in the fact that parts of the scene corresponding to a mirroring surface will still exhibit a significant photometric inconsistency, whereas the remaining parts are already reconstructed in a plausible manner. This allows us to detect mirror surfaces by fitting geometric primitives to such inconsistent regions in this initial stage of the training. Using this information, we then jointly optimize the radiance field and mirror geometry in a second training stage to refine their quality. We demonstrate the capability of our method to allow the faithful detection of mirrors in the scene as well as the reconstruction of a single consistent scene representation, and demonstrate its potential in comparison to baseline and mirror-aware approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density for Neural Implicit Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727v2)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in the volume density by modeling uncertainty in the occupancy, without the need for additional networks, making it particularly suited for challenging observations and uncontrolled image environments. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by providing an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in addressing uncertainties solely through geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies when interpreting scenes with insufficient real-world observations. While previous efforts have relied on auxiliary networks, we propose a series of formulation extensions to NeRF that manage uncertainties in density, both color and density, and occupancy, all without the need for additional networks. In experiments, we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset. Given that uncertainty modeling aligns well with the inherently uncertain environments of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we applied our approach to SLAM systems and observed notable improvements in mapping and tracking performance. These results confirm the effectiveness of our Bayesian NeRF approach in quantifying uncertainty based on geometric structure, making it a robust solution for challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Previous works (e.g, NeRF-Det) have demonstrated that implicit representation has the capacity to benefit the visual 3D perception task in indoor scenes with high amount of overlap between input images. However, previous works cannot fully utilize the advancement of implicit representation because of fixed sampling and simple multi-view feature fusion. In this paper, inspired by sparse fashion method (e.g, DETR3D), we propose a simple yet effective method, NeRF-DetS, to address above issues. NeRF-DetS includes two modules: Progressive Adaptive Sampling Strategy (PASS) and Depth-Guided Simplified Multi-Head Attention Fusion (DS-MHA). Specifically, (1)PASS can automatically sample features of each layer within a dense 3D detector, using offsets predicted by the previous layer. (2)DS-MHA can not only efficiently fuse multi-view features with strong occlusion awareness but also reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate our NeRF-DetS outperforms NeRF-Det, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP under IoU25 and IoU50, respectively. Also, NeRF-DetS shows consistent improvements on ARKITScenes.</p></details> |  |

We propose that identifying and establishing fine-grained and generalizable correspondences between driving signals and generated results can simultaneously resolve both problems. Here we present LokiTalk, a novel framework designed to enhance NeRF-based talking heads with lifelike facial dynamics and improved training efficiency. To achieve fine-grained correspondences, we introduce Region-Specific Deformation Fields, which decompose the overall portrait motion into lip movements, eye blinking, head pose, and torso movements. By hierarchically modeling the driving signals and their associated regions through two cascaded deformation fields, we significantly improve dynamic accuracy and minimize synthetic artifacts. Furthermore, we propose ID-Aware Knowledge Transfer, a plug-and-play module that learns generalizable dynamic and static correspondences from multi-identity videos, while simultaneously extracting ID-specific dynamic and static features to refine the depiction of individual characters. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LokiTalk delivers superior high-fidelity results and training efficiency compared to previous methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/LokiTalk/</p></details> |

These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds. Our code will be made publically available.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial vulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat landscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), remains underexplored. This work introduces \textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework for crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \textit{AdvIRL} generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box attacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range of scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g., lighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence misclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a cannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond attacking, \textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as adversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems. The implementation of \textit{AdvIRL} is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Tommy-Nguyen-cpu/AdvIRL/tree/MultiView-Clean}, ensuring reproducibility and facilitating future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

However, the substantial data volumes pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing solutions typically optimize NeRF representation and compression independently or focus on a single fixed rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff. In this paper, we propose VRVVC, a novel end-to-end joint optimization variable-rate framework for volumetric video compression that achieves variable bitrates using a single model while maintaining superior RD performance. Specifically, VRVVC introduces a compact tri-plane implicit residual representation for inter-frame modeling of long-duration dynamic scenes, effectively reducing temporal redundancy. We further propose a variable-rate residual representation compression scheme that leverages a learnable quantization and a tiny MLP-based entropy model. This approach enables variable bitrates through the utilization of predefined Lagrange multipliers to manage the quantization error of all latent representations. Finally, we present an end-to-end progressive training strategy combined with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRVVC achieves a wide range of variable bitrates within a single model and surpasses the RD performance of existing methods across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF-NQA: No-Reference Quality Assessment for Scenes Generated by NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08029v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references. An implementation of this paper are available at https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-NQA.</p></details> |  |

While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improved training efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024 https://github.com/sbsws88/TFS-NeRF</p></details> |
| **[NeRF Inpainting with Geometric Diffusion Prior and Balanced Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15551v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in NeRF inpainting have leveraged pretrained diffusion models to enhance performance. However, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their ineffective utilization of 2D diffusion priors. The limitations manifest in two critical aspects: the inadequate capture of geometric information by pretrained diffusion models and the suboptimal guidance provided by existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. To address these problems, we introduce GB-NeRF, a novel framework that enhances NeRF inpainting through improved utilization of 2D diffusion priors. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a fine-tuning strategy that simultaneously learns appearance and geometric priors and a specialized normal distillation loss that integrates these geometric priors into NeRF inpainting. We propose a technique called Balanced Score Distillation (BSD) that surpasses existing methods such as Score Distillation (SDS) and the improved version, Conditional Score Distillation (CSD). BSD offers improved inpainting quality in appearance and geometric aspects. Extensive experiments show that our method provides superior appearance fidelity and geometric consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Towards Degradation-Robust Reconstruction in Generalizable NeRF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11691v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) across scenes has been proven to be an effective way to avoid per-scene optimization by representing a scene with deep image features of source images. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, there has been limited research on the robustness of GNeRFs to different types of degradation present in the source images. The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 6th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems</p></details> |

Building on disentangled Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed in varying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can then be applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectively rendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity. Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn various transformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlight not only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practical applications in computer graphics. We publish our method implementation, along with our synthetic/real datasets on https://github.com/astra-vision/BRDFTransform</p></details> |  |
| **[LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06757v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable performances in producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS2023)</p></details> |
| **[Rate-aware Compression for NeRF-based Volumetric Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05322v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICME 2024</p></details> |

Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS)</p></details> |

Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024</p></details> |

However, to the best of our knowledge, existing works do not explicitly model the distribution of training camera poses, or consequently the triangulation quality, a key factor affecting reconstruction quality dating back to classical vision literature. We close this gap with ProvNeRF, an approach that models the \textbf{provenance} for each point -- i.e., the locations where it is likely visible -- of NeRFs as a stochastic field. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional space with an optimizable objective. We show that modeling per-point provenance during the NeRF optimization enriches the model with information on triangulation leading to improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty estimation under the challenging sparse, unconstrained view setting against competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

NeRF uses a volumetric functional representation that maps 3D points to their corresponding colors and opacities, allowing for photorealistic view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. Despite its advancements, the efficient streaming of NeRF content remains a significant challenge due to the large amount of data involved. This paper investigates the rate-distortion performance of two NeRF streaming strategies: pixel-based and neural network (NN) parameter-based streaming. While in the former, images are coded and then transmitted throughout the network, in the latter, the respective NeRF model parameters are coded and transmitted instead. This work also highlights the trade-offs in complexity and performance, demonstrating that the NN parameter-based strategy generally offers superior efficiency, making it suitable for one-to-many streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This loss is computed on the demonstrated grasp trajectory and the gradients of the landscape. With second order optimization, we incorporate valuable information from the trajectory as well as facilitate the optimization process of the implicit policy.

| **[Few-shot NeRF by Adaptive Rendering Loss Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17839v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis with sparse inputs poses great challenges to Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Recent works demonstrate that the frequency regularization of Positional Encoding (PE) can achieve promising results for few-shot NeRF. In this work, we reveal that there exists an inconsistency between the frequency regularization of PE and rendering loss. This prevents few-shot NeRF from synthesizing higher-quality novel views. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision. In this way, AR-NeRF can learn global structures better in the early training phase and adaptively learn local details throughout the training process. Extensive experiments show that our AR-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, including object-level and complex scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |
| **[Visual Localization in 3D Maps: Comparing Point Cloud, Mesh, and NeRF Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11966v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in mapping techniques have enabled the creation of highly accurate dense 3D maps during robotic missions, such as point clouds, meshes, or NeRF-based representations. These developments present new opportunities for reusing these maps for localization. However, there remains a lack of a unified approach that can operate seamlessly across different map representations. This paper presents and evaluates a global visual localization system capable of localizing a single camera image across various 3D map representations built using both visual and lidar sensing. Our system generates a database by synthesizing novel views of the scene, creating RGB and depth image pairs. Leveraging the precise 3D geometric map, our method automatically defines rendering poses, reducing the number of database images while preserving retrieval performance. To bridge the domain gap between real query camera images and synthetic database images, our approach utilizes learning-based descriptors and feature detectors. We evaluate the system's performance through extensive real-world experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings, assessing the effectiveness of each map representation and demonstrating its advantages over traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) localization approaches. The results show that all three map representations can achieve consistent localization success rates of 55% and higher across various environments. NeRF synthesized images show superior performance, localizing query images at an average success rate of 72%. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advantage over SfM-based approaches that our synthesized database enables localization in the reverse travel direction which is unseen during the mapping process. Our system, operating in real-time on a mobile laptop equipped with a GPU, achieves a processing rate of 1Hz.</p></details> |  |

GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsnerf/ GitHub: https://github.com/dunbar12138/DSNeRF</p></details> |

When combined with human prior knowledge, high-quality human rendering can be achieved even with sparse input views. However, the inference of these methods is still slow, as a large number of neural network queries on each ray are required to ensure the rendering quality. Moreover, occluded regions often suffer from artifacts, especially when the input views are sparse. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable human NeRF framework that achieves high-quality and real-time rendering with sparse input views by extensively leveraging human prior knowledge. We accelerate the rendering with a two-stage sampling reduction strategy: first constructing boundary meshes around the human geometry to reduce the number of ray samples for sampling guidance regression, and then volume rendering using fewer guided samples. To improve rendering quality, especially in occluded regions, we propose an occlusion-aware attention mechanism to extract occlusion information from the human priors, followed by an image space refinement network to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, for volume rendering, we adopt a signed ray distance function (SRDF) formulation, which allows us to propose an SRDF loss at every sample position to improve the rendering quality further. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and has a competitive rendering speed compared with speed-prioritized novel view synthesis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/LarsPh/EG-HumanNeRF</p></details> |
| **[NeRF-enabled Analysis-Through-Synthesis for ISAR Imaging of Small Everyday Objects with Sparse and Noisy UWB Radar Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10085v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging presents a formidable challenge when it comes to small everyday objects due to their limited Radar Cross-Section (RCS) and the inherent resolution constraints of radar systems. Existing ISAR reconstruction methods including backprojection (BP) often require complex setups and controlled environments, rendering them impractical for many real-world noisy scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Analysis-through-Synthesis (ATS) framework enabled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for high-resolution coherent ISAR imaging of small objects using sparse and noisy Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data with an inexpensive and portable setup. Our end-to-end framework integrates ultra-wideband radar wave propagation, reflection characteristics, and scene priors, enabling efficient 2D scene reconstruction without the need for costly anechoic chambers or complex measurement test beds. With qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques and generates ISAR images of complex scenes with multiple targets and complex structures in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and noisy scenarios, particularly with limited number of views and sparse UWB radar scans. This work represents a significant step towards practical, cost-effective ISAR imaging of small everyday objects, with broad implications for robotics and mobile sensing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

| **[OPONeRF: One-Point-One NeRF for Robust Neural Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20043v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a One-Point-One NeRF (OPONeRF) framework for robust scene rendering. Existing NeRFs are designed based on a key assumption that the target scene remains unchanged between the training and test time. However, small but unpredictable perturbations such as object movements, light changes and data contaminations broadly exist in real-life 3D scenes, which lead to significantly defective or failed rendering results even for the recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework in OPONeRF that adaptively responds to local scene variations via personalizing appropriate point-wise parameters, instead of fitting a single set of NeRF parameters that are inactive to test-time unseen changes. Moreover, to explicitly capture the local uncertainty, we decompose the point representation into deterministic mapping and probabilistic inference. In this way, OPONeRF learns the sharable invariance and unsupervisedly models the unexpected scene variations between the training and testing scenes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct benchmarks from both realistic and synthetic data with diverse test-time perturbations including foreground motions, illumination variations and multi-modality noises, which are more challenging than conventional generalization and temporal reconstruction benchmarks. Experimental results show that our OPONeRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRFs on various evaluation metrics through benchmark experiments and cross-scene evaluations. We further show the efficacy of the proposed method via experimenting on other existing generalization-based benchmarks and incorporating the idea of One-Point-One NeRF into other advanced baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and dataset: https://yzheng97.github.io/OPONeRF/</p></details> |

Despite demonstrating impressive rendering speed and quality, the rapid convergence of such models poses challenges for further improving reconstruction quality. Common strategies to improve rendering quality involves augmenting model parameters or increasing the number of sampled points. However, these computationally intensive approaches encounter limitations in achieving significant quality enhancements. This study introduces a model-agnostic framework inspired by Sparsely-Gated Mixture of Experts to enhance rendering quality without escalating computational complexity. Our approach enables specialization in rendering different scene components by employing a mixture of experts with varying resolutions. We present a novel gate formulation designed to maximize expert capabilities and propose a resolution-based routing technique to effectively induce sparsity and decompose scenes. Our work significantly improves reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted to the ECCV 2024 conference</p></details> |
| **[Deformable NeRF using Recursively Subdivided Tetrahedra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04402v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promise in novel view synthesis, their implicit representation limits explicit control over object manipulation. Existing research has proposed the integration of explicit geometric proxies to enable deformation. However, these methods face two primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks.

However, a collaborative approach requires a distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with less accurate relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

| **[Distributed NeRF Learning for Collaborative Multi-Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20289v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective environment perception is crucial for enabling downstream robotic applications. Individual robotic agents often face occlusion and limited visibility issues, whereas multi-agent systems can offer a more comprehensive mapping of the environment, quicker coverage, and increased fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a collaborative multi-agent perception system where agents collectively learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) from posed RGB images to represent a scene. Each agent processes its local sensory data and shares only its learned NeRF model with other agents, reducing communication overhead. Given NeRF's low memory footprint, this approach is well-suited for robotic systems with limited bandwidth, where transmitting all raw data is impractical. Our distributed learning framework ensures consistency across agents' local NeRF models, enabling convergence to a unified scene representation. We show the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments on datasets containing challenging real-world scenes, achieving performance comparable to centralized mapping of the environment where data is sent to a central server for processing. Additionally, we find that multi-agent learning provides regularization benefits, improving geometric consistency in scenarios with sparse input views. We show that in such scenarios, multi-agent mapping can even outperform centralized training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints. This capability has significant advantages for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling, and content creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics. This paper addresses the problem of NeRF view synthesis (NVS) quality assessment thoroughly, by conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several scene classes and recently proposed NVS methods. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. This study found that errors in camera pose estimation can result in spatial misalignments between synthesized and reference images, which need to be corrected before applying an objective quality metric. The experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation of several NVS methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and 360-degree camera trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[CompoNeRF: Text-guided Multi-object Compositional NeRF with Editable 3D Scene Layout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13843v5)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D form plays a crucial role in creating editable 3D scenes for AR/VR. Recent advances have shown promise in merging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However, one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of 'guidance collapse' and further enhance scene consistency, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object-specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a complex text into the layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next, a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts accuracy. Noticeably, our composition design permits decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open-source Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF generates multi-object scenes with high fidelity. Remarkably, our framework achieves up to a \textbf{54\%} improvement by the multi-view CLIP score metric. Our user study indicates that our method has significantly improved semantic accuracy, multi-view consistency, and individual recognizability for multi-object scene generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ternary-Type Opacity and Hybrid Odometry for RGB NeRF-SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the challenge of deploying Neural Radiance Field (NeRFs) in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) under the condition of lacking depth information, relying solely on RGB inputs. The key to unlocking the full potential of NeRF in such a challenging context lies in the integration of real-world priors. A crucial prior we explore is the binary opacity prior of 3D space with opaque objects. To effectively incorporate this prior into the NeRF framework, we introduce a ternary-type opacity (TT) model instead, which categorizes points on a ray intersecting a surface into three regions: before, on, and behind the surface. This enables a more accurate rendering of depth, subsequently improving the performance of image warping techniques. Therefore, we further propose a novel hybrid odometry (HO) scheme that merges bundle adjustment and warping-based localization. Our integrated approach of TT and HO achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, in terms of both speed and accuracy. This breakthrough underscores the potential of NeRF-SLAM in navigating complex environments with high fidelity.</p></details> | IROS 2024 |

While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instant Uncertainty Calibration of NeRFs Using a Meta-Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02350v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have markedly improved novel view synthesis, accurate uncertainty quantification in their image predictions remains an open problem. The prevailing methods for estimating uncertainty, including the state-of-the-art Density-aware NeRF Ensembles (DANE) [29], quantify uncertainty without calibration. This frequently leads to over- or under-confidence in image predictions, which can undermine their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method which, for the first time, achieves calibrated uncertainties for NeRFs. To accomplish this, we overcome a significant challenge in adapting existing calibration techniques to NeRFs: a need to hold out ground truth images from the target scene, reducing the number of images left to train the NeRF. This issue is particularly problematic in sparse-view settings, where we can operate with as few as three images. To address this, we introduce the concept of a meta-calibrator that performs uncertainty calibration for NeRFs with a single forward pass without the need for holding out any images from the target scene. Our meta-calibrator is a neural network that takes as input the NeRF images and uncalibrated uncertainty maps and outputs a scene-specific calibration curve that corrects the NeRF's uncalibrated uncertainties. We show that the meta-calibrator can generalize on unseen scenes and achieves well-calibrated and state-of-the-art uncertainty for NeRFs, significantly beating DANE and other approaches. This opens opportunities to improve applications that rely on accurate NeRF uncertainty estimates such as next-best view planning and potentially more trustworthy image reconstruction for medical diagnosis.

Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit-NeRF-QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics.

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects. By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024.

This constrained data requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users. In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method. Our contribution is not only in extending the capabilities of existing techniques but also in establishing a foundation for scalable and efficient large-scale scene representation using NeRF and octree structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, version accepted by Siggraph Asia</p></details> |

In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call \textit{NeRFmentation}, trains NeRFs on each scene in a dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset, KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving dataset, and our own synthetic test set.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses key challenges in multi-robot 3D reconstruction, including inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. We introduce a method for using wireless Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and ranging measurements to estimate relative poses between robots, as well as quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty embedded in the wireless localization of these pose estimates into the NeRF training loss to mitigate the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Furthermore, we propose an active view selection approach that accounts for robot pose uncertainty when determining the next-best views to improve the 3D reconstruction, enabling faster convergence through intelligent view selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in theory and in practice. Leveraging wireless coordination and localization uncertainty-aware training, MULAN-WC can achieve high-quality 3d reconstruction which is close to applying the ground truth camera poses. Furthermore, the quantification of the information gain from a novel view enables consistent rendering quality improvement with incrementally captured images by commending the robot the novel view position. Our hardware experiments showcase the practicality of deploying MULAN-WC to real robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of predicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide enough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries yielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision during NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be perfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more challenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in depth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or uncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know that depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through L2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth metrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'24), October 14-18, 2024, Salt Lake City, UT, USA</p></details> |

MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which provide the current benchmark in terms of quality for the generation of novel views of complex 3D scenes from a limited set of 2D images, represent a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training of these models requires the knowledge of the respective camera positions from which the images were viewed. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing HyperNeRFGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture employing a hypernetwork paradigm to transform a Gaussian noise into the weights of a NeRF architecture that does not utilize viewing directions in its training phase. Consequently, as evidenced by the findings of our experimental study, the proposed model, despite its notable simplicity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrates superior performance on a diverse range of image datasets where camera position estimation is challenging, particularly in the context of medical data.</p></details> |  |

Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p></details> | ECCV24 camera ready |

Previous solutions for learning NeRFs with sparse views and noisy poses only consider local geometry consistency with pairs of views. Closely following \textit{bundle adjustment} in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), we introduce TrackNeRF for more globally consistent geometry reconstruction and more accurate pose optimization. TrackNeRF introduces \textit{feature tracks}, \ie connected pixel trajectories across \textit{all} visible views that correspond to the \textit{same} 3D points. By enforcing reprojection consistency among feature tracks, TrackNeRF encourages holistic 3D consistency explicitly. Through extensive experiments, TrackNeRF sets a new benchmark in noisy and sparse view reconstruction. In particular, TrackNeRF shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art BARF and SPARF by $\sim8$ and $\sim1$ in terms of PSNR on DTU under various sparse and noisy view setups.

However, the computational cost of NeRF rendering and degradation in quality due to the presence of artifacts pose significant challenges for its application in real-time and robust robotic tasks, especially on embedded systems. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates NeRF-derived localization information with Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide a robust solution for real-time robotic navigation. By training an absolute pose regression network with augmented image data rendered from a NeRF and quantifying its uncertainty, our approach effectively counters positional drift and enhances system reliability. We also establish a mathematically sound foundation for combining visual inertial navigation with camera localization neural networks, considering uncertainty under a Bayesian framework. Experimental validation in a photorealistic simulation environment demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy compared to a conventional VIO approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024, 8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the occlusion of invisible voxels by scene surfaces poses challenges to current SSC methods in hallucinating refined 3D geometry. This paper proposes HybridOcc, a hybrid 3D volume query proposal method generated by Transformer framework and NeRF representation and refined in a coarse-to-fine SSC prediction framework. HybridOcc aggregates contextual features through the Transformer paradigm based on hybrid query proposals while combining it with NeRF representation to obtain depth supervision. The Transformer branch contains multiple scales and uses spatial cross-attention for 2D to 3D transformation. The newly designed NeRF branch implicitly infers scene occupancy through volume rendering, including visible and invisible voxels, and explicitly captures scene depth rather than generating RGB color. Furthermore, we present an innovative occupancy-aware ray sampling method to orient the SSC task instead of focusing on the scene surface, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HybridOcc on the SSC task.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE RAL |

Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP. Overall, VIRUS-NeRF presents a promising approach for cost-effective local mapping in mobile robotics, with potential applications in safety and navigation tasks.

We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to reconstruct the dynamic scenes and struggle to fit even the training views in unsynchronized settings. It happens because they employ a single latent embedding for a frame while the multi-view images at the same frame were actually captured at different moments. To address this limitation, we introduce time offsets for individual unsynchronized videos and jointly optimize the offsets with NeRF. By design, our method is applicable for various baselines and improves them with large margins. Furthermore, finding the offsets naturally works as synchronizing the videos without manual effort. Experiments are conducted on the common Plenoptic Video Dataset and a newly built Unsynchronized Dynamic Blender Dataset to verify the performance of our method.

However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually fail to capture the complex geometric details of plants, which is crucial for phenotyping and breeding studies. We evaluate the reconstruction fidelity of NeRFs in three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.6% F1 score after 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficacy of NeRFs for 3D reconstruction in challenging environments. Additionally, we propose an early stopping technique for NeRF training that almost halves the training time while achieving only a reduction of 7.4% in the average F1 score. This optimization process significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of 3D reconstruction using NeRFs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of NeRFs in detailed and realistic 3D plant reconstruction and suggest practical approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency of NeRFs in the 3D reconstruction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 'Plant Phenomics'</p></details> |

NeRF models produce state-of-the-art quality for many 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks but require substantial computational resources. The encoding of the scene information within the NeRF network parameters necessitates stochastic sampling. We observe that during the training, a major part of the compute time and memory usage is spent on processing already learnt samples, which no longer affect the model update significantly. We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph. As our method only interfaces with the network module, we expect it to be widely applicable.</p></details> |  |

While many works have focused on generating 3D human models, they suffer one or more of the following: lack of distinctive features, unnatural shading/shadows, unnatural poses/clothes, limited views, etc. InceptionHuman achieves consistent 3D human generation within a progressively refined NeRF space with two novel modules, Iterative Pose-Aware Refinement (IPAR) and Progressive-Augmented Reconstruction (PAR). IPAR iteratively refines the diffusion-generated images and synthesizes high-quality 3D-aware views considering the close-pose RGB values. PAR employs a pretrained diffusion prior to augment the generated synthetic views and adds regularization for view-independent appearance. Overall, the synthesis of photorealistic novel views empowers the resulting 3D human NeRF from 360-degree perspectives. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison show that our InceptionHuman models achieve state-of-the-art application quality.</p></details> |  |

Although there are extensive works on image-level attacks, most are restricted to 2D pixel spaces, and such attacks are not always physically realistic in our 3D world. Here we present Adv3D, the first exploration of modeling adversarial examples as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Advances in NeRF provide photorealistic appearances and 3D accurate generation, yielding a more realistic and realizable adversarial example. We train our adversarial NeRF by minimizing the surrounding objects' confidence predicted by 3D detectors on the training set. Then we evaluate Adv3D on the unseen validation set and show that it can cause a large performance reduction when rendering NeRF in any sampled pose. To generate physically realizable adversarial examples, we propose primitive-aware sampling and semantic-guided regularization that enable 3D patch attacks with camouflage adversarial texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained adversarial NeRF generalizes well to different poses, scenes, and 3D detectors. Finally, we provide a defense method to our attacks that involves adversarial training through data augmentation. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/adv3d-web</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges. Our results reveal that this methodology achieves more consistent, lifelike, and detailed edits than existing leading methods for text-driven NeRF scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D Sc...</summary><p>3D Scene Editing, Neural Rendering, Diffusion Models, Accepted to ECCV24</p></details> |

Traditionally, 3D mapping, or scene reconstruction, has relied on expensive LiDAR sensing. Photogrammetry can perform image-based 3D reconstruction but is computationally expensive and requires extremely dense image representation to recover complex geometry and photorealism. NeRFs perform 3D scene reconstruction by training a neural network on sparse image and pose data, achieving superior results to photogrammetry with less input data. This paper presents an evaluation of two NeRF scene reconstructions for the purpose of estimating the diameter of a vertical PVC cylinder. One of these are trained on commodity iPhone data and the other is trained on robot-sourced imagery and poses. This neural-geometry is compared to state-of-the-art lidar-inertial SLAM in terms of scene noise and metric-accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes.

Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.</p></details> | accepted to eccv2024 |

While gradient-based optimization in a NeRF framework updates the initial pose, this paper highlights that scale-depth ambiguity in monocular object reconstruction causes failures when the initial pose deviates moderately from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present SUP-NeRF, a Streamlined Unification of object Pose estimation and NeRF-based object reconstruction. SUP-NeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces a camera-invariant projected-box representation that generalizes cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, SUP-NeRF is free from external 3D detectors. SUP-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, SUP-NeRF exhibits exceptional cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50\% reduction in rotation and translation error.</p></details> |  |

Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF-Guided Unsupervised Learning of RGB-D Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00507v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration. Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field (NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model. Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset, Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper reproduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matching Query Image Against Selected NeRF Feature for Efficient and Scalable Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11766v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural implicit representations such as NeRF have revolutionized 3D scene representation with photo-realistic quality. However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Our method defines the transformation as a 3D flow, specifically as a weighted linear blending of rigid transformations of 3D anchor points that are defined on the surface of the scene. In order to identify anchor points, we introduce a novel correspondence algorithm that first matches RGB-based pairs, then leverages multi-view information and 3D reprojection to robustly filter false positives in two steps. We also introduce a new dataset for exploring the problem of modifying a NeRF scene through a single observation. Our dataset ( https://github.com/nerfdeformer/nerfdeformer ) contains 113 synthetic scenes leveraging 47 3D assets. We show that our proposed method outperforms NeRF editing methods as well as diffusion-based methods, and we also explore different methods for filtering correspondences.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main paper, CVPR 2024.

Key to our approach are: (i) a dynamic hypernetwork, which learns a smooth mapping from text token embeddings to the space of NeRFs; (ii) NeRF distillation training, which distills scenes encoded in individual NeRFs into one dynamic hypernetwork. These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes -- either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024, Project page: https://threedle.github.io/hyperfields/</p></details> |

Recent NeRFs utilize feature grids to improve rendering quality and speed; however, these representations introduce significant storage overhead. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently compressing a grid-based NeRF model, addressing the storage overhead concern. Our approach is based on the non-linear transform coding paradigm, employing neural compression for compressing the model's feature grids. Due to the lack of training data involving many i.i.d scenes, we design an encoder-free, end-to-end optimized approach for individual scenes, using lightweight decoders. To leverage the spatial inhomogeneity of the latent feature grids, we introduce an importance-weighted rate-distortion objective and a sparse entropy model employing a masking mechanism. Our experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing works in terms of grid-based NeRF compression efficacy and reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

Given their potential, considerable efforts have been invested to improve their performance. Nonetheless, the essential question of selecting training views is yet to be thoroughly investigated. This key aspect plays a vital role in achieving high-quality results and aligns with the well-known tenet of deep learning: "garbage in, garbage out". In this paper, we first illustrate the importance of view selection by demonstrating how a simple rotation of the test views within the most pervasive NeRF dataset can lead to consequential shifts in the performance rankings of state-of-the-art techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a unified framework for view selection methods and devise a thorough benchmark to assess its impact. Significant improvements can be achieved without leveraging error or uncertainty estimation but focusing on uniform view coverage of the reconstructed object, resulting in a training-free approach. Using this technique, we show that high-quality renderings can be achieved faster by using fewer views. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and realistic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with random, conventional error-based, and uncertainty-guided view selection.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |
| **[Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729v5)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Lifting of Multiview to 3D from Unknown Pose: Wrapping NeRF inside Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06972v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We cast multiview reconstruction from unknown pose as a generative modeling problem. From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  |

To expedite the rendering process, learnable explicit representations have been introduced for combination with implicit NeRF representation, which however results in a large storage space requirement. In this paper, we introduce the Context-based NeRF Compression (CNC) framework, which leverages highly efficient context models to provide a storage-friendly NeRF representation. Specifically, we excavate both level-wise and dimension-wise context dependencies to enable probability prediction for information entropy reduction. Additionally, we exploit hash collision and occupancy grids as strong prior knowledge for better context modeling. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct and exploit context models for NeRF compression. We achieve a size reduction of 100$\times$ and 70$\times$ with improved fidelity against the baseline Instant-NGP on Synthesic-NeRF and Tanks and Temples datasets, respectively. Additionally, we attain 86.7\% and 82.3\% storage size reduction against the SOTA NeRF compression method BiRF.

However, the scalability and accuracy of the inferred geometry are not well-documented for large-scale aerial assets,since such datasets usually result in very high memory consumption and slow convergence.. In this paper, we aim to scale the NeRF on large-scael aerial datasets and provide a thorough geometry assessment of NeRF. Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image loading for RAM, representation training for GPU memory, and increase the convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a loss of accuracy. We implement our method on a representative approach, Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS pipelines on two typical aerial datasets against LiDAR reference data. Both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the proposed NeRF approach produces better completeness and object details than traditional approaches, although as of now, it still falls short in terms of accuracy.</p></details> | 9 Figure |

In this paper, we introduce NeRF On-the-go, a simple yet effective approach that enables the robust synthesis of novel views in complex, in-the-wild scenes from only casually captured image sequences. Delving into uncertainty, our method not only efficiently eliminates distractors, even when they are predominant in captures, but also achieves a notably faster convergence speed.

Standard simulator-based rendering often fails to accurately reflect real-world performance due to the sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between virtual simulations and real-world conditions. To mitigate this gap, we propose a workflow for building a high-fidelity simulation environment of the targeted real-world scene using NeRF. This approach is capable of rendering realistic images from novel viewpoints and constructing 3D meshes for emulating collisions. The validation of these capabilities through the comparison of success rates in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the benefits of using DriveEnv-NeRF as a real-world performance indicator. Furthermore, the DriveEnv-NeRF framework can serve as a training environment for autonomous driving agents under various lighting conditions. This approach enhances the robustness of the agents and reduces performance degradation when deployed to the target real scene, compared to agents fully trained using the standard simulator rendering pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/muyishen2040/DriveEnvNeRF</p></details> |

However, different architectures, including the plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their combinations, entail distinct trade-offs. For instance, representations based on Hashtables enable faster rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, thereby posing challenges for spatial-relation-aware editing. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any conversion between diverse architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the rendering process. Additionally, a three-level active learning technique provides continuous feedback from teacher to student during the distillation process, achieving high-performance outcomes. Experimental evidence showcases the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmark datasets. For instance, PVD-AL can distill an MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and 0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the MLP-based model from scratch. Moreover, PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures, enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient model to meet real-time requirements like mobile devices.

After the first research of NeRF is proposed, NeRF has gained a robust developing power and is booming in the 3D modeling, representation and reconstruction areas. However the first and most of the followed research projects based on NeRF is static, which are weak in the practical applications. Therefore, more researcher are interested and focused on the study of dynamic NeRF that is more feasible and useful in practical applications or situations.

This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.</p></details> |  |

A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.</p></details> |  |

However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities.

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery.

(2023)'s influential work on the New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest (NYCCC). Their study exposed a substantial gap between LLMs and humans in humor comprehension, establishing that understanding and evaluating creative content is key challenge in AI development. We revisit this challenge by decomposing humor understanding into three components and systematically improve each: enhancing visual understanding through improved annotation, utilizing LLM-generated humor reasoning and explanations, and implementing targeted alignment with human preference data. Our refined approach achieves 82.4% accuracy in caption ranking, singificantly improving upon the previous 67% benchmark and matching the performance of world-renowned human experts in this domain. Notably, while attempts to mimic subgroup preferences through various persona prompts showed minimal impact, model finetuning with crowd preferences proved remarkably effective. These findings reveal that LLM limitations in creative judgment can be effectively addressed through focused alignment to specific subgroups and individuals. Lastly, we propose the position that achieving artificial general intelligence necessitates systematic collection of human preference data across creative domains. We advocate that just as human creativity is deeply influenced by individual and cultural preferences, training LLMs with diverse human preference data may be essential for developing true creative understanding.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sparse Auto-Encoder Interprets Linguistic Features in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20344v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks that require complex linguistic abilities, such as reference disambiguation and metaphor recognition/generation. Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Previous work on linguistic mechanisms has been limited by coarse granularity, insufficient causal analysis, and a narrow focus. In this study, we present a systematic and comprehensive causal investigation using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). We extract a wide range of linguistic features from six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by constructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We introduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature Intervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to capture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential for controlling model outputs. This work provides strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.</p></details> |  |

A common strategy involves generating multiple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectories and aggregating their outputs through various selection mechanisms. This raises a fundamental question: can models with lower complexity leverage their superior generation throughput to outperform similarly sized Transformers for a fixed computational budget? To address this question and overcome the lack of strong subquadratic reasoners, we distill pure and hybrid Mamba models from pretrained Transformers. Trained on only 8 billion tokens, our distilled models show strong performance and scaling on mathematical reasoning datasets while being much faster at inference for large batches and long sequences. Despite the zero-shot performance hit due to distillation, both pure and hybrid Mamba models can scale their coverage and accuracy performance past their Transformer teacher models under fixed time budgets, opening a new direction for scaling inference compute.</p></details> |  |

We share an application architecture, the Large Language Expert (LLE), that combines the flexibility and power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the interpretability, explainability, and reliability of Expert Systems. LLMs help address key challenges of Expert Systems, such as integrating and codifying knowledge, and data normalization. Conversely, an Expert System-like approach helps overcome challenges with LLMs, including hallucinations, atomic and inexpensive updates, and testability. To highlight the power of the Large Language Expert (LLE) system, we built an LLE to assist with the workup of patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Timely initiation of cancer treatment is critical for optimal patient outcomes. However, increasing complexity in diagnostic recommendations has made it difficult for primary care physicians to ensure their patients have completed the necessary workup before their first visit with an oncologist. As with many real-world clinical tasks, these workups require the analysis of unstructured health records and the application of nuanced clinical decision logic. In this study, we describe the design & evaluation of an LLE system built to rapidly identify and suggest the correct diagnostic workup. The system demonstrated a high degree of clinical-level accuracy (>95%) and effectively addressed gaps identified in real-world data from breast and colon cancer patients at a large academic center.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20332v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models, but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20330v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |

Their exceptional capabilities suggest their potential as scientific research assistants but also highlight the need for holistic, rigorous, and domain-specific evaluation to assess effectiveness in real-world scientific applications. This paper describes a multifaceted methodology for Evaluating AI models as scientific Research Assistants (EAIRA) developed at Argonne National Laboratory. This methodology incorporates four primary classes of evaluations. 1) Multiple Choice Questions to assess factual recall; 2) Open Response to evaluate advanced reasoning and problem-solving skills; 3) Lab-Style Experiments involving detailed analysis of capabilities as research assistants in controlled environments; and 4) Field-Style Experiments to capture researcher-LLM interactions at scale in a wide range of scientific domains and applications. These complementary methods enable a comprehensive analysis of LLM strengths and weaknesses with respect to their scientific knowledge, reasoning abilities, and adaptability. Recognizing the rapid pace of LLM advancements, we designed the methodology to evolve and adapt so as to ensure its continued relevance and applicability. This paper describes the methodology state at the end of February 2025. Although developed within a subset of scientific domains, the methodology is designed to be generalizable to a wide range of scientific domains.</p></details> | 33 pages, 18 figures |

However, their reliance on well-prepared tools limits their applicability in the medical domain, which requires to train specialized models. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present M3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning (ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents that collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from automated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto debugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML workspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text descriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling seamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in automated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four general tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging modalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven state-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system, such as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic designs, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical imaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent core, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in medical imaging.</p></details> | 38 pages, 7 figures |

Existing NLP and supervised Machine Learning methods perform well under cross-validation but struggle to generalise across datasets, even within the same domain. This issue stems from coarsely labelled training data, where articles are labelled based on their publisher, introducing biases that token-based models like TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive to. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, their application in fake news detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful features can still be extracted from coarsely labelled data to improve real-world robustness. Stylistic features-lexical, syntactic, and semantic-are explored due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. Additionally, novel social-monetisation features are introduced, capturing economic incentives behind fake news, such as advertisements, external links, and social media elements. The study trains on the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset and evaluates using the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset, a gold standard for generalisability. Results highlight the limitations of token-based models trained on biased data and contribute to the scarce evidence on LLMs like LLaMa in this field. Findings indicate that stylistic and social-monetisation features offer more generalisable predictions than token-based methods and LLMs. Statistical and permutation feature importance analyses further reveal their potential to enhance performance and mitigate dataset biases, providing a path forward for improving fake news detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Expert Systems with Applications (Elsevier)</p></details> |

When combined with formal proof assistants like Lean, these hallucinations can be eliminated through rigorous verification, making theorem proving reliable. However, even with formal verification, LLMs still struggle with long proofs and complex mathematical formalizations. While Lean with LLMs offers valuable assistance with retrieving lemmas, generating tactics, or even complete proofs, it lacks a crucial capability: providing a sense of proof progress. This limitation particularly impacts the overall development efficiency in large formalization projects. We introduce LeanProgress, a method that predicts the progress in the proof. Training and evaluating our models made on a large corpus of Lean proofs from Lean Workbook Plus and Mathlib4 and how many steps remain to complete it, we employ data preprocessing and balancing techniques to handle the skewed distribution of proof lengths. Our experiments show that LeanProgress achieves an overall prediction accuracy of 75.1\% in predicting the amount of progress and, hence, the remaining number of steps. When integrated into a best-first search framework using Reprover, our method shows a 3.8\% improvement on Mathlib4 compared to baseline performances of 41.2\%, particularly for longer proofs. These results demonstrate how proof progress prediction can enhance both automated and interactive theorem proving, enabling users to make more informed decisions about proof strategies.</p></details> |  |

While modern optical character recognition (OCR) engines are proficient with printed text, their performance on handwriting is limited, often requiring costly labeled data for fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for transcribing multi-page handwritten documents in a zero-shot setting. We investigate various configurations of commercial OCR engines and MLLMs, utilizing the latter both as end-to-end transcribers and as post-processors, with and without image components. We propose a novel method, '+first page', which enhances MLLM transcription by providing the OCR output of the entire document along with just the first page image. This approach leverages shared document features without incurring the high cost of processing all images. Experiments on a multi-page version of the IAM Handwriting Database demonstrate that '+first page' improves transcription accuracy, balances cost with performance, and even enhances results on out-of-sample text by extrapolating formatting and OCR error patterns from a single page.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (including references and appendix), 14 figures, accepted at AAAI-25 Workshop on Document Understanding and Intelligence, non-archival</p></details> |

This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Tail Risk Control for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20285v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread usage for various tasks. The prevalence of LLMs in society implores the assurance on the reliability of their performance. In particular, risk-sensitive applications demand meticulous attention to unexpectedly poor outcomes, i.e., tail events, for instance, toxic answers, humiliating language, and offensive outputs. Due to the costly nature of acquiring human annotations, general-purpose scoring models have been created to automate the process of quantifying these tail events. This phenomenon introduces potential human-machine misalignment between the respective scoring mechanisms. In this work, we present a lightweight calibration framework for blackbox models that ensures the alignment of humans and machines with provable guarantees. Our framework provides a rigorous approach to controlling any distortion risk measure that is characterized by a weighted average of quantiles of the loss incurred by the LLM with high confidence. The theoretical foundation of our method relies on the connection between conformal risk control and a traditional family of statistics, i.e., L-statistics. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments that address the issue of human-machine misalignment.</p></details> |  |

However, trust--a critical factor in the adoption of planning systems--remains underexplored in the context of LLM-based planning tasks. This study bridges this gap by comparing human trust in LLM-based planners with classical planners through a user study in a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain. Combining subjective measures, such as trust questionnaires, with objective metrics like evaluation accuracy, our findings reveal that correctness is the primary driver of trust and performance. Explanations provided by the LLM improved evaluation accuracy but had limited impact on trust, while plan refinement showed potential for increasing trust without significantly enhancing evaluation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Attribution Regularizers for Efficient Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20268v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.03321 This version adds a new model to our experimental setup, modifies the paper's main discussion, and updates the authorship list</p></details> |

Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, adhering to complex instructions remains a major challenge. Current approaches to generating complex instructions are often irrelevant to the current instruction requirements or suffer from limited scalability and diversity. Moreover, methods such as back-translation, while effective for simple instruction generation, fail to leverage the rich contents and structures in large web corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic iterative refinement framework to generate complex instructions with constraints, which not only better reflects the requirements of real scenarios but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. The AIR framework consists of two stages: (1)Generate an initial instruction from a document; (2)Iteratively refine instructions with LLM-as-judge guidance by comparing the model's output with the document to incorporate valuable constraints. Finally, we construct the AIR-10K dataset with 10K complex instructions and demonstrate that instructions generated with our approach significantly improve the model's ability to follow complex instructions, outperforming existing methods for instruction generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally, 20 pages</p></details> |

This work addresses the difficult and underexplored case of users who have very sparse interactions but post informative review texts. This setting naturally calls for encoding user-specific text with large language models (LLM). However, feeding the full text of all reviews through an LLM has a weak signal-to-noise ratio and incurs high costs of processed tokens. This paper addresses these two issues. It presents a light-weight framework, called CUP, which first computes concise user profiles and feeds only these into the training of transformer-based recommenders. For user profiles, we devise various techniques to select the most informative cues from noisy reviews. Experiments, with book reviews data, show that fine-tuning a small language model with judiciously constructed profiles achieves the best performance, even in comparison to LLM-generated rankings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first four authors contributed equally, 27 pages</p></details> |

However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior. Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions. Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision. Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.</p></details> |  |

In the meantime, AI companions have become increasingly popular as friends or gendered romantic partners to their users. This study bridges the gap by devising three experiments tailored for romantic, gender-assigned AI companions and their users, effectively evaluating implicit biases across various-sized LLMs. Each experiment looks at a different dimension: implicit associations, emotion responses, and sycophancy. This study aims to measure and compare biases manifested in different companion systems by quantitatively analysing persona-assigned model responses to a baseline through newly devised metrics. The results are noteworthy: they show that assigning gendered, relationship personas to Large Language Models significantly alters the responses of these models, and in certain situations in a biased, stereotypical way.</p></details> |  |
| **[Liquid: Language Models are Scalable and Unified Multi-modal Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04332v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Liquid, an auto-regressive generation paradigm that seamlessly integrates visual comprehension and generation by tokenizing images into discrete codes and learning these code embeddings alongside text tokens within a shared feature space for both vision and language. Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation.

Existing LLMs may generate factually incorrect information within the complex e-commerce applications. Therefore, it is necessary to build an e-commerce concept benchmark. Existing benchmarks encounter two primary challenges: (1) handle the heterogeneous and diverse nature of tasks, (2) distinguish between generality and specificity within the e-commerce field. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{ChineseEcomQA}, a scalable question-answering benchmark focused on fundamental e-commerce concepts. ChineseEcomQA is built on three core characteristics: \textbf{Focus on Fundamental Concept}, \textbf{E-commerce Generality} and \textbf{E-commerce Expertise}. Fundamental concepts are designed to be applicable across a diverse array of e-commerce tasks, thus addressing the challenge of heterogeneity and diversity. Additionally, by carefully balancing generality and specificity, ChineseEcomQA effectively differentiates between broad e-commerce concepts, allowing for precise validation of domain capabilities. We achieve this through a scalable benchmark construction process that combines LLM validation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) validation, and rigorous manual annotation. Based on ChineseEcomQA, we conduct extensive evaluations on mainstream LLMs and provide some valuable insights. We hope that ChineseEcomQA could guide future domain-specific evaluations, and facilitate broader LLM adoption in e-commerce applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache Compression Based on Global-Local Importance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08521v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic: Disentangling Task-Specific and Instruction-Following Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20186v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong task-specific capabilities through fine-tuning, but merging multiple fine-tuned models often leads to degraded performance due to overlapping instruction-following components. Task Arithmetic (TA), which combines task vectors derived from fine-tuning, enables multi-task learning and task forgetting but struggles to isolate task-specific knowledge from general instruction-following behavior. To address this, we propose Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic (LATA), a novel approach that assigns layer-specific weights to task vectors based on their alignment with instruction-following or task-specific components. By amplifying task-relevant layers and attenuating instruction-following layers, LATA improves task learning and forgetting performance while preserving overall model utility. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including WikiText-2, GSM8K, and HumanEval, demonstrate that LATA outperforms existing methods in both multi-task learning and selective task forgetting, achieving higher task accuracy and alignment with minimal degradation in output quality. Our findings highlight the importance of layer-wise analysis in disentangling task-specific and general-purpose knowledge, offering a robust framework for efficient model merging and editing.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the potential of LLMs to understand and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), an essential representation in artificial intelligence planning. We conduct an extensive analysis across 20 distinct models spanning 7 major LLM families, both commercial and open-source. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the zero-shot LLM capabilities of parsing, generating, and reasoning with PDDL. Our findings indicate that while some models demonstrate notable effectiveness in handling PDDL, others pose limitations in more complex scenarios requiring nuanced planning knowledge. These results highlight the promise and current limitations of LLMs in formal planning tasks, offering insights into their application and guiding future efforts in AI-driven planning paradigms.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[The Impact of Unstated Norms in Bias Analysis of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03471v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias in large language models (LLMs) has many forms, from overt discrimination to implicit stereotypes. Counterfactual bias evaluation is a widely used approach to quantifying bias and often relies on template-based probes that explicitly state group membership. It measures whether the outcome of a task performed by an LLM is invariant to a change in group membership. In this work, we find that template-based probes can lead to unrealistic bias measurements. For example, LLMs appear to mistakenly cast text associated with White race as negative at higher rates than other groups. We hypothesize that this arises artificially via a mismatch between commonly unstated norms, in the form of markedness, in the pretraining text of LLMs (e.g., Black president vs. president) and templates used for bias measurement (e.g., Black president vs. White president). The findings highlight the potential misleading impact of varying group membership through explicit mention in counterfactual bias quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, 4 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

However, many benchmarks used for such evaluations suffer from systematic biases. Remarkably, Large Language Models (LLMs) without any visual perception capabilities achieve non-trivial performance, undermining the credibility of these evaluations. To address this issue while maintaining the efficiency of MCQ evaluations, we propose MMEvalPro, a benchmark designed to avoid Type-I errors through a trilogy evaluation pipeline and more rigorous metrics. For each original question from existing benchmarks, human annotators augment it by creating one perception question and one knowledge anchor question through a meticulous annotation process. MMEvalPro comprises $2,138$ question triplets, totaling $6,414$ distinct questions. Two-thirds of these questions are manually labeled by human experts, while the rest are sourced from existing benchmarks (MMMU, ScienceQA, and MathVista). Compared with the existing benchmarks, our experiments with the latest LLMs and LMMs demonstrate that MMEvalPro is more challenging (the best LMM lags behind human performance by $31.73\%$, compared to an average gap of $8.03\%$ in previous benchmarks) and more trustworthy (the best LLM trails the best LMM by $23.09\%$, whereas the gap for previous benchmarks is just $14.64\%$). Our in-depth analysis explains the reason for the large performance gap and justifies the trustworthiness of evaluation, underscoring its significant potential for advancing future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, code released at https://github.com/chenllliang/MMEvalPro, Homepage at https://mmevalpro.github.io/</p></details> |

Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To enhance long-context capabilities, constructing high-quality training data with long-range dependencies is crucial. Existing methods to select long-context data often rely on sentence-level analysis, which can be greatly optimized in both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies long-range dependencies, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter LongABC-32K from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code). Through our comprehensive experiments, LongAttn has demonstrated its excellent effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency. To facilitate future research in long-context data, we released our code and the high-quality long-context training data LongABC-32K.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews on scale. We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training. Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoA: Attention-aware Post-training Quantization without Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13474v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Early methods developed for smaller networks like ResNet rely on gradient-based optimization, which becomes impractical for hyper-scale LLMs with billions of parameters. While recently proposed backpropagation-free or transformation-based methods alleviate this issue, their performance remains limited by either a lack of inter-layer dependency consideration or the use of naive nearest-rounding-based integer weight assignment to save the heavy computational cost of weight optimization. We thus introduce a novel backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that optimizes integer weights by considering inter-layer dependencies. The key innovation is the development of attention-aware Hessian matrices that capture inter-layer interactions within the attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms existing weight quantization methods but also shows good synergy with conventional methods to suppress activation outliers, leading to state-of-the-art weight-activation quantization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, under review</p></details> |

However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of the algorithms that Transformer+CoT can learn. In this work, we (1) evaluate the state tracking capabilities of Transformer+CoT and its variants, confirming the effectiveness of CoT. (2) Next, we identify the circuit, a subset of model components, responsible for tracking the world state, finding that late-layer MLP neurons play a key role. We propose two metrics, compression and distinction, and show that the neuron sets for each state achieve nearly 100% accuracy, providing evidence of an implicit finite state automaton (FSA) embedded within the model. (3) Additionally, we explore three realistic settings: skipping intermediate steps, introducing data noise, and testing length generalization. Our results demonstrate that Transformer+CoT learns robust algorithms (FSA), highlighting its resilience in challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

Evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11807v6)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making is a complex process requiring diverse abilities, making it an excellent framework for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought. We also evaluate 13 LLMs from 6 model families, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms others, scoring of $69.8$ out of $100$, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B ($65.9$) and Mixtral-8x22B ($62.4$).

ChatMotion dynamically interprets user intent, decomposes complex tasks into meta-tasks, and activates specialized function modules for motion comprehension. It integrates multiple specialized modules, such as the MotionCore, to analyze human motion from various perspectives.

This is achieved by three contributions: (1) a hypothesis that insufficient training in higher RoPE dimensions contributes to the persistent out-of-distribution (OOD) issues observed in existing methods; (2) an effective RoPE rescaling algorithm that adopts evolutionary search guided by "needle-driven" perplexity to address the insufficient training problem; (3) a mixed context window training approach that fine-tunes model weights to adopt rescaled RoPE for long-context sequences while preserving the short-context performance with the original RoPE. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3-8B and Phi3-mini-3.8B across various benchmarks validate the hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LongRoPE2. Remarkably, LongRoPE2 extends LLaMA3-8B to achieve a 128K effective context length while retaining over 98.5% of short-context performance, using only 10B tokens -- 80x fewer than Meta's approach, which fails to reach the target effective context length.

| **[AgentSquare: Automatic LLM Agent Search in Modular Design Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06153v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

This paper proposes a new LLM-powered Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) benchmark, Collab-Overcooked, built on the popular Overcooked-AI game with more applicable and challenging tasks in interactive environments. Collab-Overcooked extends existing benchmarks from two novel perspectives. First, it provides a multi-agent framework supporting diverse tasks and objectives and encourages collaboration through natural language communication. Second, it introduces a spectrum of process-oriented evaluation metrics to assess the fine-grained collaboration capabilities of different LLM agents, a dimension often overlooked in prior work. We conduct extensive experiments over 10 popular LLMs and show that, while the LLMs present a strong ability in goal interpretation, there is a significant discrepancy in active collaboration and continuous adaption that are critical for efficiently fulfilling complicated tasks. Notably, we highlight the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-MAS and provide insights for improving and evaluating LLM-MAS on a unified and open-sourced benchmark.

However, despite the growing capabilities of long-context LLMs, the safety issues in long-context scenarios remain underexplored. While safety alignment in short context has been widely studied, the safety concerns of long-context LLMs have not been adequately addressed. In this work, we introduce \textbf{LongSafety}, a comprehensive safety alignment dataset for long-context LLMs, containing 10 tasks and 17k samples, with an average length of 40.9k tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that training with LongSafety can enhance long-context safety performance while enhancing short-context safety and preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-context safety does not equal long-context alignment with short-context safety data and LongSafety has generalizing capabilities in context length and long-context safety scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information distribution in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level "novelty." Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

It concerns the construction of triplets that contain an aspect, its associated sentiment polarity, and an opinion phrase that serves as a rationale for the assigned polarity. Despite the growing popularity of the task and the many machine learning methods being proposed to address it, the number of datasets for ASTE is very limited. In particular, no dataset is available for any of the Slavic languages. In this paper, we present two new datasets for ASTE containing customer opinions about hotels and purchased products expressed in Polish. We also perform experiments with two ASTE techniques combined with two large language models for Polish to investigate their performance and the difficulty of the assembled datasets. The new datasets are available under a permissive licence and have the same file format as the English datasets, facilitating their use in future research.</p></details> |  |

However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.

Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.</p></details> | ICLR |

Enter Query Localization!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14117v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear. The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the Knowledge Localization (KL) assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons. However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid regarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention module in knowledge expression. In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its limitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new findings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge storage and the other on knowledge expression. We summarize these findings as \textbf{Query Localization} (QL) assumption and argue that the KL assumption can be viewed as a simplification of the QL assumption. Based on QL assumption, we further propose the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification, further validating our new assumption. We conduct 39 sets of experiments, along with additional visualization experiments, to rigorously confirm our conclusions.

However, complex datasets often contain inherent conflicts -- stemming from modality-specific optimization objectives -- and latent commonalities that enable cross-task transfer, which most existing approaches handle separately. To bridge this gap, we introduce AsymLoRA, a parameter-efficient tuning framework that unifies knowledge modularization and cross-modal coordination via asymmetric LoRA: task-specific low-rank projections (matrix B) that preserve distinct adaptation pathways for conflicting objectives, and a shared projection (matrix A) that consolidates cross-modal commonalities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AsymLoRA consistently surpasses both vanilla LoRA, which captures only commonalities, and LoRA-MoE, which focuses solely on conflicts, achieving superior model performance and system efficiency across diverse benchmarks.\href{Code}{https://github.com/Clin0212/HydraLoRA/blob/main/MLLM-HydraLoRA/README.md}.</p></details> |  |

With large corporations offering affordable consumer-grade head-mounted displays (HMDs), XR will likely become pervasive, and HMDs will develop as personal devices like smartphones and tablets. However, having intelligent spaces and naturalistic interactions in XR is as important as technological advances so that users grow their engagement in virtual and augmented spaces. To this end, large language model (LLM)--powered non-player characters (NPCs) with speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models bring significant advantages over conventional or pre-scripted NPCs for facilitating more natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) in XR. This paper provides the community with an open-source, customizable, extendable, and privacy-aware Unity package, CUIfy, that facilitates speech-based NPC-user interaction with widely used LLMs, STT, and TTS models. Our package also supports multiple LLM-powered NPCs per environment and minimizes latency between different computational models through streaming to achieve usable interactions between users and NPCs. We publish our source code in the following repository: https://gitlab.lrz.de/hctl/cuify</p></details> | <details><summary>7th I...</summary><p>7th IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & eXtended and Virtual Reality (IEEE AIxVR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01928v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13461v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout. Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaxInfo: A Training-Free Key-Frame Selection Method Using Maximum Volume for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03183v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) often rely on uniform frame sampling for video understanding, but this approach frequently fails to capture critical information due to frame redundancy and variations in video content. We propose MaxInfo, a training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which selects and retains the most representative frames from the input video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. It also achieves a 3.47% improvement for LLaVA-Video-72B. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Unintended Memorization with LoRA in Federated Learning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05087v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative training which avoids direct data exposure between clients. However, data privacy issues still remain: FL-trained large language models are capable of memorizing and completing phrases and sentences contained in training data when given with their prefixes. Thus, it is possible for adversarial and honest-but-curious clients to recover training data of other participants simply through targeted prompting. In this work, we demonstrate that a popular and simple fine-tuning strategy, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), reduces memorization during FL up to a factor of 10. We study this effect by performing a medical question-answering fine-tuning task and injecting multiple replicas of out-of-distribution sensitive sequences drawn from an external clinical dataset. We observe a reduction in memorization for a wide variety of Llama 2 and 3 models, and find that LoRA can reduce memorization in centralized learning as well. Furthermore, we show that LoRA can be combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as gradient clipping and Gaussian noising, secure aggregation, and Goldfish loss to further improve record-level privacy while maintaining performance.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to prevent unlearned models from recalling any related memory of the targeted knowledge.We begin by uncovering a surprisingly simple yet overlooked fact: existing methods typically erase only the exact expressions of the targeted knowledge, leaving paraphrased or related information intact. To rigorously measure such oversights, we introduce UGBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating the generalisation performance across 13 state-of-the-art methods.UGBench reveals that unlearned models can still recall paraphrased answers and retain target facts in intermediate layers. To address this, we propose PERMU, a perturbation-based method that significantly enhances the generalisation capabilities for safeguarding LLM unlearning.Experiments demonstrate that PERMU delivers up to a 50.13% improvement in unlearning while maintaining a 43.53% boost in robust generalisation. Our code can be found in https://github.com/MaybeLizzy/UGBench.</p></details> |  |

We show that this struggle arises from LLMs' use of a simple one-digit lookahead heuristic, which works fairly well (but not perfect) for two-operand addition but fails in multi-operand cases, where the carry-over logic is more complex. Our probing experiments and digit-wise accuracy evaluation show that LLMs fail precisely where a one-digit lookahead is insufficient to account for cascading carries. We analyze the impact of tokenization strategies on arithmetic performance and show that all investigated models, regardless of tokenization, are inherently limited in the addition of multiple operands due to their reliance on a one-digit lookahead heuristic. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations that prevent LLMs from generalizing to more complex numerical reasoning.</p></details> | Pre-print |

An Exploration of Their Ability to Unlock Information in Complex Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19973v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining multiple perceptual inputs and performing combinatorial reasoning in complex scenarios is a sophisticated cognitive function in humans. With advancements in multi-modal large language models, recent benchmarks tend to evaluate visual understanding across multiple images. However, they often overlook the necessity of combinatorial reasoning across multiple perceptual information. To explore the ability of advanced models to integrate multiple perceptual inputs for combinatorial reasoning in complex scenarios, we introduce two benchmarks: Clue-Visual Question Answering (CVQA), with three task types to assess visual comprehension and synthesis, and Clue of Password-Visual Question Answering (CPVQA), with two task types focused on accurate interpretation and application of visual data. For our benchmarks, we present three plug-and-play approaches: utilizing model input for reasoning, enhancing reasoning through minimum margin decoding with randomness generation, and retrieving semantically relevant visual information for effective data integration. The combined results reveal current models' poor performance on combinatorial reasoning benchmarks, even the state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source model achieves only 33.04% accuracy on CVQA, and drops to 7.38% on CPVQA. Notably, our approach improves the performance of models on combinatorial reasoning, with a 22.17% boost on CVQA and 9.40% on CPVQA over the SOTA closed-source model, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing combinatorial reasoning with multiple perceptual inputs in complex scenarios. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 11pages |

Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.13% and an F1 score of 0.87. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEE-Bench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Electrical And Electronics Engineering Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01492v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated promising skills in various domains including science and mathematics. However, their capability in more challenging and real-world related scenarios like engineering has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we propose EEE-Bench, a multimodal benchmark aimed at assessing LMMs' capabilities in solving practical engineering tasks, using electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) as the testbed. Our benchmark consists of 2860 carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains such as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to benchmarks in other domains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and versatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these problems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and textual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract circuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions, making them excellent candidates for LMM evaluations. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide extensive quantitative evaluations and fine-grained analysis of 17 widely-used open and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs. Our results demonstrate notable deficiencies of current foundation models in EEE, with an average performance ranging from 19.48% to 46.78%. Finally, we reveal and explore a critical shortcoming in LMMs which we term laziness: the tendency to take shortcuts by relying on the text while overlooking the visual context when reasoning for technical image problems. In summary, we believe EEE-Bench not only reveals some noteworthy limitations of LMMs but also provides a valuable resource for advancing research on their application in practical engineering tasks, driving future improvements in their capability to handle complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The psychology of LLMs as random number generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19965v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text generation through inherently probabilistic context-aware mechanisms, mimicking human natural language. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of various LLMs when generating random numbers, considering diverse configurations such as different model architectures, numerical ranges, temperature, and prompt languages. Our results reveal that, despite their stochastic transformers-based architecture, these models often exhibit deterministic responses when prompted for random numerical outputs. In particular, we find significant differences when changing the model, as well as the prompt language, attributing this phenomenon to biases deeply embedded within the training data. Models such as DeepSeek-R1 can shed some light on the internal reasoning process of LLMs, despite arriving to similar results. These biases induce predictable patterns that undermine genuine randomness, as LLMs are nothing but reproducing our own human cognitive biases.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

While standalone spell correction approaches have been proposed, they show limited performance for historical documents due to numerous possible OCR error combinations and differences between modern and classical corpus distributions. We propose a method utilizing available content-focused ebooks as a reference base to correct imperfect OCR-generated text, supported by large language models. This technique generates high-precision pseudo-page-to-page labels for diacritic languages, where small strokes pose significant challenges in historical conditions. The pipeline eliminates various types of noise from aged documents and addresses issues such as missing characters, words, and disordered sequences. Our post-processing method, which generated a large OCR dataset of classical Vietnamese books, achieved a mean grading score of 8.72 on a 10-point scale. This outperformed the state-of-the-art transformer-based Vietnamese spell correction model, which scored 7.03 when evaluated on a sampled subset of the dataset. We also trained a baseline OCR model to assess and compare it with well-known engines. Experimental results demonstrate the strength of our baseline model compared to widely used open-source solutions. The resulting dataset will be released publicly to support future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the AAAI 2025 (39th) AISI track.

This work presents SeisMoLLM, the first foundation model that utilizes cross-modal transfer for seismic monitoring, to unleash the power of large-scale pre-training from a large language model without requiring direct pre-training on seismic datasets. Through elaborate waveform tokenization and fine-tuning of pre-trained GPT-2 model, SeisMoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DiTing and STEAD datasets across five critical tasks: back-azimuth estimation, epicentral distance estimation, magnitude estimation, phase picking, and first-motion polarity classification. It attains 36 best results out of 43 task metrics and 12 top scores out of 16 few-shot generalization metrics, with many relative improvements ranging from 10% to 50%. In addition to its superior performance, SeisMoLLM maintains efficiency comparable to or even better than lightweight models in both training and inference. These findings establish SeisMoLLM as a promising foundation model for practical seismic monitoring and highlight cross-modal transfer as an exciting new direction for earthquake studies, showcasing the potential of advanced deep learning techniques to propel seismology research forward.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures.

Current studies prioritize Large Language Models (LLMs) over Small Language Models (SLMs) due to the overwhelming performance improving provided by LLMs. However, heavily relying on LLMs for stance detection, regardless of the cost, is impractical for real-world social media monitoring systems that require vast data analysis. To this end, we propose \textbf{\underline{Co}}llaborative Stance Detection via Small-Large Language Model Consistency \textbf{\underline{Ver}}ification (\textbf{CoVer}) framework, which enhances LLM utilization via context-shared batch reasoning and logical verification between LLM and SLM. Specifically, instead of processing each text individually, CoVer processes texts batch-by-batch, obtaining stance predictions and corresponding explanations via LLM reasoning in a shared context. Then, to exclude the bias caused by context noises, CoVer introduces the SLM for logical consistency verification. Finally, texts that repeatedly exhibit low logical consistency are classified using consistency-weighted aggregation of prior LLM stance predictions. Our experiments show that CoVer outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks in the zero-shot setting, achieving 0.54 LLM queries per tweet while significantly enhancing performance. Our CoVer offers a more practical solution for LLM deploying for social media stance detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19953v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying and Mitigating Social Bias Knowledge in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11843v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating fair and accurate predictions plays a pivotal role in deploying large language models (LLMs) in the real world. However, existing debiasing methods inevitably generate unfair or incorrect predictions as they are designed and evaluated to achieve parity across different social groups but leave aside individual commonsense facts, resulting in modified knowledge that elicits unreasonable or undesired predictions. In this paper, we first establish a new bias mitigation benchmark, BiaScope, which systematically assesses performance by leveraging newly constructed datasets and metrics on knowledge retention and generalization. Then, we propose a novel debiasing approach, Fairness Stamp (FAST), which enables fine-grained calibration of individual social biases. FAST identifies the decisive layer responsible for storing social biases and then calibrates its outputs by integrating a small modular network, considering both bias mitigation and knowledge-preserving demands. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FAST surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with superior debiasing performance while not compromising the overall model capability for knowledge retention and downstream predictions. This highlights the potential of fine-grained debiasing strategies to achieve fairness in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Findings. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.09341</p></details> |

However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs "contextual multi-armed bandits" to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress, and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, they often suffer from critical flaws, including misaligned instruction-image pairs and low-quality images. Such issues hinder training efficiency and limit performance improvements, as models waste resources on noisy or irrelevant data with minimal benefit to overall capability. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{Vi}sual-Centric \textbf{S}election approach via \textbf{A}gents Collaboration (ViSA), which centers on image quality assessment and image-instruction relevance evaluation. Specifically, our approach consists of 1) an image information quantification method via visual agents collaboration to select images with rich visual information, and 2) a visual-centric instruction quality assessment method to select high-quality instruction data related to high-quality images. Finally, we reorganize 80K instruction data from large open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViSA outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art models on seven benchmarks, using only 2.5\% of the original data, highlighting the efficiency of our data selection approach. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ViSA.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, current KT models face three major challenges: (1) When encountering new questions, models face cold-start problems due to sparse interaction records, making precise modeling difficult; (2) Traditional models only use historical interaction records for student personalization modeling, unable to accurately track individual mastery levels, resulting in unclear personalized modeling; (3) The decision-making process is opaque to educators, making it challenging for them to understand model judgments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-channel Difficulty-aware Knowledge Tracing (DDKT) framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for subjective difficulty assessment, while integrating difficulty bias-aware algorithms and student mastery algorithms for precise difficulty measurement. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) Difficulty Balance Perception Sequence (DBPS) - students' subjective perceptions combined with objective difficulty, measuring gaps between LLM-assessed difficulty, mathematical-statistical difficulty, and students' subjective perceived difficulty through attention mechanisms; (2) Difficulty Mastery Ratio (DMR) - precise modeling of student mastery levels through different difficulty zones; (3) Knowledge State Update Mechanism - implementing personalized knowledge acquisition through gated networks and updating student knowledge state. Experimental results on two real datasets show our method consistently outperforms nine baseline models, improving AUC metrics by 2% to 10% while effectively addressing cold-start problems and enhancing model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Driven by the need for cost-effective training, recent work explores efficient communication arrangement for end to end training. Motivated by LLM's resistance to layer skipping and layer reordering, in this paper, we explore stage (several consecutive layers) skipping in pipeline training, and challenge the conventional practice of sequential pipeline execution. We derive convergence and throughput constraints (guidelines) for pipelining with skipping and swapping pipeline stages. Based on these constraints, we propose SkipPipe, the first partial pipeline framework to reduce the end-to-end training time for LLMs while preserving the convergence. The core of SkipPipe is a path scheduling algorithm that optimizes the paths for individual microbatches and reduces idle time (due to microbatch collisions) on the distributed nodes, complying with the given stage skipping ratio. We extensively evaluate SkipPipe on LLaMa models from 500M to 8B parameters on up to 20 nodes. Our results show that SkipPipe reduces training iteration time by up to $55\%$ compared to full pipeline. Our partial pipeline training also improves resistance to layer omission during inference, experiencing a drop in perplexity of only $7\%$ when running only half the model. Our code is available at https://github.com/gensyn-ai/skippipe.</p></details> |  |

Existing factual consistency (FC) metrics are constrained by their performance, efficiency, and explainability. Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in text evaluation but their effectiveness in assessing FC in summarization remains underexplored. Prior research has mostly focused on proprietary LLMs, leaving essential factors that affect their assessment capabilities unexplored. Additionally, current FC evaluation benchmarks are restricted to news articles, casting doubt on the generality of the FC methods tested on them. In this paper, we first address the gap by introducing TreatFact a dataset of LLM-generated summaries of clinical texts, annotated for FC by domain experts. Moreover, we benchmark 11 LLMs for FC evaluation across news and clinical domains and analyse the impact of model size, prompts, pre-training and fine-tuning data. Our findings reveal that despite proprietary models prevailing on the task, open-source LLMs lag behind. Nevertheless, there is potential for enhancing the performance of open-source LLMs through increasing model size, expanding pre-training data, and developing well-curated fine-tuning data. Experiments on TreatFact suggest that both previous methods and LLM-based evaluators are unable to capture factual inconsistencies in clinical summaries, posing a new challenge for FC evaluation.</p></details> | published on ESWA |
| **[Order Doesn't Matter, But Reasoning Does: Training LLMs with Order-Centric Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19907v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs) to ensure accurate and coherent inference. However, LLMs struggle with reasoning order variations and fail to generalize across logically equivalent transformations. LLMs often rely on fixed sequential patterns rather than true logical understanding. To address this issue, we introduce an order-centric data augmentation framework based on commutativity in logical reasoning. We first randomly shuffle independent premises to introduce condition order augmentation. For reasoning steps, we construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model dependencies between steps, which allows us to identify valid reorderings of steps while preserving logical correctness. By leveraging order-centric augmentations, models can develop a more flexible and generalized reasoning process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments across multiple logical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that our method significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning performance and adaptability to diverse logical structures. We release our codes and augmented data in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Order-Centric-Data-Augmentation-822C/.</p></details> |  |

To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.</p></details> | Accept to CVPR 2025 |
| **[Language Independent Stance Detection: Social Interaction-based Embeddings and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05715v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large majority of the research performed on stance detection has been focused on developing more or less sophisticated text classification systems, even when many benchmarks are based on social network data such as Twitter. This paper aims to take on the stance detection task by placing the emphasis not so much on the text itself but on the interaction data available on social networks. More specifically, we propose a new method to leverage social information such as friends and retweets by generating Relational Embeddings, namely, dense vector representations of interaction pairs. Our experiments on seven publicly available datasets and four different languages (Basque, Catalan, Italian, and Spanish) show that combining our relational embeddings with discriminative textual methods helps to substantially improve performance, obtaining state-of-the-art results for six out of seven evaluation settings, outperforming strong baselines based on Large Language Models, or other popular interaction-based approaches such as DeepWalk or node2vec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Tip of Efficiency: Uncovering the Submerged Threats of Jailbreak Attacks in Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19883v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages. 6 figures |

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |
| **[MMKE-Bench: A Multimodal Editing Benchmark for Diverse Visual Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19870v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing techniques have emerged as essential tools for updating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs), allowing them to correct outdated or inaccurate information without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, like the needle-in-a-haystack test, do not effectively assess whether these models fully utilize contextual information, raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation techniques. To thoroughly examine the effectiveness of existing benchmarks, we introduce a new metric called information coverage (IC), which quantifies the proportion of the input context necessary for answering queries. Our findings indicate that current benchmarks exhibit low IC; although the input context may be extensive, the actual usable context is often limited. To address this, we present ETHIC, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' ability to leverage the entire context. Our benchmark comprises 1,986 test instances spanning four long-context tasks with high IC scores in the domains of books, debates, medicine, and law. Our evaluations reveal significant performance drops in contemporary LLMs, highlighting a critical challenge in managing long contexts. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ETHIC.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

High-speed next-generation communication technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC network services. At the same time, advanced AIGC techniques can also make future network services more intelligent, especially various online content generation services. However, the significant untrustworthiness concerns of current AIGC models, such as robustness, security, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of intelligent network services, especially in ensuring secure AIGC services. This paper proposes TrustGAIN, a trustworthy AIGC framework that incorporates robust, secure, and fair network services. We first discuss the robustness to adversarial attacks faced by AIGC models in network systems and the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of avoiding unsafe and illegal services and ensuring the fairness of the AIGC network services. Then as a case study, we propose a novel sentiment analysis-based detection method to guide the robust detection of unsafe content in network services. We conduct our experiments on fake news, malicious code, and unsafe review datasets to represent LLM application scenarios. Our results indicate that TrustGAIN is an exploration of future networks that can support trustworthy AIGC network services.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIND: Towards Immersive Psychological Healing with Multi-agent Inner Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19860v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs in psychological healing.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hidden Risks of Large Reasoning Models: A Safety Assessment of R1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12659v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large reasoning models, such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1, has led to significant improvements in complex reasoning over non-reasoning large language models~(LLMs). However, their enhanced capabilities, combined with the open-source access of models like DeepSeek-R1, raise serious safety concerns, particularly regarding their potential for misuse. In this work, we present a comprehensive safety assessment of these reasoning models, leveraging established safety benchmarks to evaluate their compliance with safety regulations. Furthermore, we investigate their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, such as jailbreaking and prompt injection, to assess their robustness in real-world applications. Through our multi-faceted analysis, we uncover four key findings: (1) There is a significant safety gap between the open-source R1 models and the o3-mini model, on both safety benchmark and attack, suggesting more safety effort on R1 is needed. (2) The distilled reasoning model shows poorer safety performance compared to its safety-aligned base models. (3) The stronger the model's reasoning ability, the greater the potential harm it may cause when answering unsafe questions. (4) The thinking process in R1 models pose greater safety concerns than their final answers. Our study provides insights into the security implications of reasoning models and highlights the need for further advancements in R1 models' safety to close the gap.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code generation benchmarks fail to capture the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn interactions, limiting our ability to evaluate LLMs in these contexts. To address this gap, we present a set of novel benchmarks that explicitly model the quality of feedback provided to code generation LLMs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we introduce CONVCODEWORLD, a novel and reproducible environment for benchmarking interactive code generation. CONVCODEWORLD simulates 9 distinct interactive code generation scenarios while systematically combining three types of feedback: (a) compilation feedback; (b) execution feedback with varying test coverage; (c) verbal feedback generated by GPT-4o with different levels of expertise. Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast, static version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating the need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong Spearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third, extensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including R1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies significantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient feedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without feedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's ability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns (high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice versa.

However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked: LLMs must balance between rejecting harmful requests for safety and accommodating legitimate ones for utility. This paper presents a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based alignment framework that achieves better overall performance by addressing this ethical-utility trade-off, using chemical domain applications as a proof-of-concept. Our alignment pipeline starts with a GPT-assisted three-phase data generation scheme, in which we create LibraChemQA, a chemical question-answering dataset comprising 31.6k triplet instances. By incorporating an innovative balanced seed in the data generation process, our framework systematically considers both legitimate and illegitimate requests. The framework also introduces a rephrasing mechanism for efficient data augmentation that enhances the model's chemical comprehension. We further develop a novel hybrid evaluation scheme with LLM judges for precise assessment of both safety and utility. Experimental results demonstrate our model's substantial improvements in overall performance where both safety and utility are considered - the resulting model outperforms leading LLMs including Claude-3, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3 by margins of 13.44%, 7.16%, and 7.10% respectively on our released benchmark. At the end of this paper, we analyze experimental results obtained from testing DeepSeek-R1 on our benchmark and reveal the critical ethical concerns raised by this highly acclaimed model. We highlight that the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process employed by DeepSeek-R1, as well as other LLMs distilled from it, introduces significant ethical vulnerabilities when exposed to users.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProAPO: Progressively Automatic Prompt Optimization for Visual Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19844v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in image classification by training with large-scale paired image-text data. Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Safety in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback via Rectified Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19933v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing helpfulness and safety (harmlessness) is a critical challenge in aligning large language models (LLMs). Current approaches often decouple these two objectives, training separate preference models for helpfulness and safety, while framing safety as a constraint within a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework. This paper identifies a potential issue when using the widely adopted expected safety constraints for LLM safety alignment, termed "safety compensation", where the constraints are satisfied on expectation, but individual prompts may trade off safety, resulting in some responses being overly restrictive while others remain unsafe. To address this issue, we propose Rectified Policy Optimization (RePO), which replaces the expected safety constraint with critical safety constraints imposed on every prompt. At the core of RePO is a policy update mechanism driven by rectified policy gradients, which penalizes the strict safety violation of every prompt, thereby enhancing safety across nearly all prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that RePO outperforms strong baseline methods and significantly enhances LLM safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels. In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\times$ and 11.1$\times$ speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities remain limited when addressing domain-specific problems, particularly in downstream NLP tasks. Research has shown that models fine-tuned on instruction-based downstream NLP datasets outperform those that are not fine-tuned. While most efforts in this area have primarily focused on resource-rich languages like English and broad domains, little attention has been given to multilingual settings and specific domains. To address this gap, this study focuses on developing a specialized LLM, LlamaLens, for analyzing news and social media content in a multilingual context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle both domain specificity and multilinguality, with a particular focus on news and social media. Our experimental setup includes 18 tasks, represented by 52 datasets covering Arabic, English, and Hindi. We demonstrate that LlamaLens outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 23 testing sets, and achieves comparable performance on 8 sets.

A significant challenge in training LLMs for these formal languages is the lack of parallel datasets that align natural language with formal language proofs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel framework for translating the Mathlib4 corpus (a unified library of mathematics in formal language Lean 4) into natural language. Building upon this, we employ a dual augmentation strategy that combines tactic-based and informal-based approaches, leveraging the Lean-jixia system, a Lean 4 analyzer. We present the results of this pipeline on Mathlib4 as Herald (Hierarchy and Retrieval-based Translated Lean Dataset). We also propose the Herald Translator, which is fine-tuned on Herald. Herald translator achieves a 93.2% accuracy (Pass@128) on formalizing statements in the miniF2F-test and a 22.5% accuracy on our internal graduate-level textbook dataset, outperforming InternLM2-Math-Plus-7B (74.0% and 7.5%) and TheoremLlama (50.1% and 4.0%). Furthermore, we propose a section-level translation framework for real-world applications. As a direct application of Herald translator, we have successfully translated a template section in the Stack project, marking a notable progress in the automatic formalization of graduate-level mathematical literature. Our model, along with the datasets, are open-sourced to the public.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge-based model editing enables precise modifications to the weights of large language models in order to modify the information encoded within. Recent approaches have seen success in enabling recall of edited information for thousands of edits at once. However, these approaches fail to produce edits that account for associated contextual information. We present K-Edit, an effective approach to generating contextually consistent knowledge edits. By using knowledge graphs, which maintain contextual consistency when an edge is edited, we are able to generate additional \textit{contextual edits} that ensure consistency of related information in the language model. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multi-hop question answering while maintaining the general effectiveness and scalability of model edits.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge is jailbreak, where adversarial prompts bypass built-in safeguards to elicit harmful disallowed outputs. Inspired by psychological foot-in-the-door principles, we introduce FITD,a novel multi-turn jailbreak method that leverages the phenomenon where minor initial commitments lower resistance to more significant or more unethical transgressions.Our approach progressively escalates the malicious intent of user queries through intermediate bridge prompts and aligns the model's response by itself to induce toxic responses. Extensive experimental results on two jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that FITD achieves an average attack success rate of 94% across seven widely used models, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of LLM self-corruption, highlighting vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies and emphasizing the risks inherent in multi-turn interactions.The code is available at https://github.com/Jinxiaolong1129/Foot-in-the-door-Jailbreak .</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
