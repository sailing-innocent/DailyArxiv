| **[3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11801v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Versal AI Engine for 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11782v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataflow-oriented spatial architectures are the emerging paradigm for higher computation performance and efficiency. AMD Versal AI Engine is a commercial spatial architecture consisting of tiles of VLIW processors supporting SIMD operations arranged in a two-dimensional mesh. The architecture requires the explicit design of task assignments and dataflow configurations for each tile to maximize performance, demanding advanced techniques and meticulous design. However, a few works revealed the performance characteristics of the Versal AI Engine through practical workloads. In this work, we provide the comprehensive performance evaluation of the Versal AI Engine using Gaussian feature computation in 3D Gaussian splatting as a practical workload, and we then propose a novel dedicated algorithm to fully exploit the hardware architecture. The computations of 3D Gaussian splatting include matrix multiplications and color computations utilizing high-dimensional spherical harmonic coefficients. These tasks are processed efficiently by leveraging the SIMD capabilities and their instruction-level parallelism. Additionally, pipelined processing is achieved by assigning different tasks to individual cores, thereby fully exploiting the spatial parallelism of AI Engines. The proposed method demonstrated a 226-fold throughput increase in simulation-based evaluation, outperforming a naive approach. These findings provide valuable insights for application development that effectively harnesses the spatial and architectural advantages of AI Engines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussianMotion: End-to-End Learning of Animatable Gaussian Avatars with Pose Guidance from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11642v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce GaussianMotion, a novel human rendering model that generates fully animatable scenes aligned with textual descriptions using Gaussian Splatting. Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[3D Reconstruction of Shoes for Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18643v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.</p></details> |  |
| **[OMG: Opacity Matters in Material Modeling with Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10988v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10975v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline EventNeRF by a margin of 11-25% in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures and 3 tables; project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/E3DGS/; International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[GaussianSpa: An "Optimizing-Sparsifying" Simplification Framework for Compact and High-Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06019v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream for novel view synthesis, leveraging continuous aggregations of Gaussian functions to model scene geometry. However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS.

| **[Self-Calibrating Gaussian Splatting for Large Field of View Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09563v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a self-calibrating framework that jointly optimizes camera parameters, lens distortion and 3D Gaussian representations, enabling accurate and efficient scene reconstruction. In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://denghilbert.github.io/self-cali/</p></details> |
| **[X-SG$^2$S: Safe and Generalizable Gaussian Splatting with X-dimensional Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10475v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has been widely used in 3D reconstruction and 3D generation. Training to get a 3DGS scene often takes a lot of time and resources and even valuable inspiration. The increasing amount of 3DGS digital asset have brought great challenges to the copyright protection. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. In this paper, we propose a new framework X-SG$^2$S which can simultaneously watermark 1 to 3D messages while keeping the original 3DGS scene almost unchanged. Generally, we have a X-SG$^2$S injector for adding multi-modal messages simultaneously and an extractor for extract them. Specifically, we first split the watermarks into message patches in a fixed manner and sort the 3DGS points. A self-adaption gate is used to pick out suitable location for watermarking. Then use a XD(multi-dimension)-injection heads to add multi-modal messages into sorted 3DGS points. A learnable gate can recognize the location with extra messages and XD-extraction heads can restore hidden messages from the location recommended by the learnable gate. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed X-SG$^2$S can effectively conceal multi modal messages without changing pretrained 3DGS pipeline or the original form of 3DGS parameters. Meanwhile, with simple and efficient model structure and high practicality, X-SG$^2$S still shows good performance in hiding and extracting multi-modal inner structured or unstructured messages. X-SG$^2$S is the first to unify 1 to 3D watermarking model for 3DGS and the first framework to add multi-modal watermarks simultaneous in one 3DGS which pave the wave for later researches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, several techniques have been proposed for connecting these low-level representations with the high-level semantics understanding embodied within the scene. These methods elevate the rich semantic understanding from 2D imagery to 3D representations, distilling high-dimensional spatial features onto 3D space. In our work, we are interested in connecting language with a dynamic modeling of the world. We show how to lift spatio-temporal features to a 4D representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables an interactive interface where the user can spatiotemporally localize events in the video from text prompts. We demonstrate our system on public 3D video datasets of people and animals performing various actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Eurog...</summary><p>Eurographics 2025.

| **[Gaussian-Det: Learning Closed-Surface Gaussians for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[DenseSplat: Densifying Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Neural Radiance Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09111v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian SLAM systems excel in real-time rendering and fine-grained reconstruction compared to NeRF-based systems. However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \textbf{L}arge \textbf{I}mages are \textbf{G}aussians (\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

| **[RenderWorld: World Model with Self-Supervised 3D Label](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11356v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving with vision-only is not only more cost-effective compared to LiDAR-vision fusion but also more reliable than traditional methods. To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[MiraGe: Editable 2D Images using Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01521v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09591v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Interactive Holographic Visualization for 3D Facial Avatar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08085v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods for visualizing dynamic human expressions, particularly in medical training, often rely on flat-screen displays or static mannequins, which have proven inefficient for realistic simulation. In response, we propose a platform that leverages a 3D interactive facial avatar capable of displaying non-verbal feedback, including pain signals. This avatar is projected onto a stereoscopic, view-dependent 3D display, offering a more immersive and realistic simulated patient experience for pain assessment practice. However, there is no existing solution that dynamically predicts and projects interactive 3D facial avatars in real-time. To overcome this, we emphasize the need for a 3D display projection system that can project the facial avatar holographically, allowing users to interact with the avatar from any viewpoint. By incorporating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and real-time view-dependent calibration, we significantly improve the training environment for accurate pain recognition and assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01846v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs</p></details> |
| **[MeshSplats: Mesh-Based Rendering with Gaussian Splatting Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07754v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Distillation Sampling: Regularizing 3D Gaussians with Pre-trained Matching Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07615v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved excellent rendering quality with fast training and rendering speed. However, its optimization process lacks explicit geometric constraints, leading to suboptimal geometric reconstruction in regions with sparse or no observational input views. In this work, we try to mitigate the issue by incorporating a pre-trained matching prior to the 3DGS optimization process. We introduce Flow Distillation Sampling (FDS), a technique that leverages pre-trained geometric knowledge to bolster the accuracy of the Gaussian radiance field. Our method employs a strategic sampling technique to target unobserved views adjacent to the input views, utilizing the optical flow calculated from the matching model (Prior Flow) to guide the flow analytically calculated from the 3DGS geometry (Radiance Flow). Comprehensive experiments in depth rendering, mesh reconstruction, and novel view synthesis showcase the significant advantages of FDS over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our interpretive experiments and analysis aim to shed light on the effects of FDS on geometric accuracy and rendering quality, potentially providing readers with insights into its performance.

| **[EdgeGaussians -- 3D Edge Mapping via Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12886v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With their meaningful geometry and their omnipresence in the 3D world, edges are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler, more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with the efficient training optimization defined in Gaussian Splatting. Results show that the proposed method produces edges as accurate and complete as the state-of-the-art while being an order of magnitude faster.

| **[HAC++: Towards 100X Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12255v4)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To achieve a compact size, we propose HAC++, which leverages the relationships between unorganized anchors and a structured hash grid, utilizing their mutual information for context modeling. Additionally, HAC++ captures intra-anchor contextual relationships to further enhance compression performance. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to precisely estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Moreover, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Overall, HAC++ achieves a remarkable size reduction of over 100X compared to vanilla 3DGS when averaged on all datasets, while simultaneously improving fidelity. It also delivers more than 20X size reduction compared to Scaffold-GS.

| **[PoI: Pixel of Interest for Novel View Synthesis Assisted Scene Coordinate Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04843v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of estimating camera poses can be enhanced through novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to increase the diversity and extension of training data. However, these techniques often produce rendered images with issues like blurring and ghosting, which compromise their reliability. These issues become particularly pronounced for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which estimate 3D coordinates at the pixel level. To mitigate the problems associated with unreliable rendered images, we introduce a novel filtering approach, which selectively extracts well-rendered pixels while discarding the inferior ones. This filter simultaneously measures the SCR model's real-time reprojection loss and gradient during training. Building on this filtering technique, we also develop a new strategy to improve scene coordinate regression using sparse inputs, drawing on successful applications of sparse input techniques in novel view synthesis. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.</p></details> |  |

BBSplat represents the scene as a set of optimizable textured planar primitives with learnable RGB textures and alpha-maps to control their shape. BBSplat primitives can be used in any Gaussian Splatting pipeline as drop-in replacements for Gaussians. The proposed primitives close the rendering quality gap between 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), preserving the accurate mesh extraction ability of 2D primitives. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in the storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11394v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications.

However, most existing methods prioritize appearance consistency while neglecting underlying physical principles, leading to artifacts such as unrealistic deformations, unstable dynamics, and implausible objects interactions. Incorporating physics priors into generative models has become a crucial research direction to enhance structural integrity and motion realism. This survey provides a review of physics-aware generative methods, systematically analyzing how physical constraints are integrated into 3D and 4D generation. First, we examine recent works in incorporating physical priors into static and dynamic 3D generation, categorizing methods based on representation types, including vision-based, NeRF-based, and Gaussian Splatting-based approaches. Second, we explore emerging techniques in 4D generation, focusing on methods that model temporal dynamics with physical simulations. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of major methods, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different materials and motion dynamics. By presenting an in-depth analysis of physics-grounded AIGC, this survey aims to bridge the gap between generative models and physical realism, providing insights that inspire future research in physically consistent content generation.</p></details> |  |

To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |

Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches.

This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme.

We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

While 3D occupancy models are typically trained using voxel-based supervision with standard losses (e.g., cross-entropy, Lovasz, dice), these approaches treat voxel predictions independently, neglecting their spatial relationships. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a plug-and-play 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that enhances voxel-based supervision. Our method projects 3D voxel representations into arbitrary 2D perspectives and leverages Gaussian splatting as an efficient, differentiable rendering proxy of voxels, introducing spatial dependencies across projected elements. This approach improves semantic and geometric consistency, handles occlusions more efficiently, and requires no architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, SSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate consistent performance gains across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc, Symphonies), highlighting the robustness and versatility of our framework.

We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement.

However, achieving this using a single imaging modality remains challenging. For instance, traditional RGB cameras suffer from low frame rates, limited exposure times, and narrow baselines. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion approach using Gaussian splatting, which combines RGB, depth, and event cameras to capture and reconstruct deforming scenes at high speeds. The key insight of our method lies in leveraging the complementary strengths of these imaging modalities: RGB cameras capture detailed color information, event cameras record rapid scene changes with microsecond resolution, and depth cameras provide 3D scene geometry. To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities, we represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene movements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal deformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This fusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even under challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid motion. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets captured with our prototype sensor fusion setup demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving noticeable improvements in both rendering fidelity and structural accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework Gaussian Processes Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), where a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to achieve adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. The densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians to enhance reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets across various scales validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 14 pages,11 figures |

However, in real-world environments with dynamic objects, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems often face mapping errors and tracking drift issues. To address these problems, we propose GARAD-SLAM, a real-time 3DGS-based SLAM system tailored for dynamic scenes. In terms of tracking, unlike traditional methods, we directly perform dynamic segmentation on Gaussians and map them back to the front-end to obtain dynamic point labels through a Gaussian pyramid network, achieving precise dynamic removal and robust tracking. For mapping, we impose rendering penalties on dynamically labeled Gaussians, which are updated through the network, to avoid irreversible erroneous removal caused by simple pruning. Our results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is competitive in tracking compared to baseline methods, generating fewer artifacts and higher-quality reconstructions in rendering.</p></details> |  |

Given 2D visual prompts as input, SAGA can segment the corresponding 3D target represented by 3D Gaussians within 4 ms. This is achieved by attaching an scale-gated affinity feature to each 3D Gaussian to endow it a new property towards multi-granularity segmentation. Specifically, a scale-aware contrastive training strategy is proposed for the scale-gated affinity feature learning. It 1) distills the segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from 2D masks into the affinity features and 2) employs a soft scale gate mechanism to deal with multi-granularity ambiguity in 3D segmentation through adjusting the magnitude of each feature channel according to a specified 3D physical scale. Evaluations demonstrate that SAGA achieves real-time multi-granularity segmentation with quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[GS-CPR: Efficient Camera Pose Refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11085v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement (CPR) framework, GS-CPR. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets.

| **[GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13971v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussNav: Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11625v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied vision, Instance ImageGoal Navigation (IIN) requires an agent to locate a specific object depicted in a goal image within an unexplored environment. The primary challenge of IIN arises from the need to recognize the target object across varying viewpoints while ignoring potential distractors. Existing map-based navigation methods typically use Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps, which lack detailed texture representation of a scene. Consequently, while BEV maps are effective for semantic-level visual navigation, they are struggling for instance-level tasks. To this end, we propose a new framework for IIN, Gaussian Splatting for Visual Navigation (GaussNav), which constructs a novel map representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The GaussNav framework enables the agent to memorize both the geometry and semantic information of the scene, as well as retain the textural features of objects. By matching renderings of similar objects with the target, the agent can accurately identify, ground, and navigate to the specified object. Our GaussNav framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement, with Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) increasing from 0.347 to 0.578 on the challenging Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) dataset.

| **[LAYOUTDREAMER: Physics-guided Layout for Text-to-3D Compositional Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01949v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the field of text-guided 3D scene generation has garnered significant attention. High-quality generation that aligns with physical realism and high controllability is crucial for practical 3D scene applications. However, existing methods face fundamental limitations: (i) difficulty capturing complex relationships between multiple objects described in the text, (ii) inability to generate physically plausible scene layouts, and (iii) lack of controllability and extensibility in compositional scenes. In this paper, we introduce LayoutDreamer, a framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to facilitate high-quality, physically consistent compositional scene generation guided by text. Specifically, given a text prompt, we convert it into a directed scene graph and adaptively adjust the density and layout of the initial compositional 3D Gaussians. Subsequently, dynamic camera adjustments are made based on the training focal point to ensure entity-level generation quality. Finally, by extracting directed dependencies from the scene graph, we tailor physical and layout energy to ensure both realism and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LayoutDreamer outperforms other compositional scene generation quality and semantic alignment methods. Specifically, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the multiple objects generation metric of T3Bench.</p></details> |  |

An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io/</p></details> |

However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[CityLoc: 6DoF Pose Distributional Localization for Text Descriptions in Large-Scale Scenes with Gaussian Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08982v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing textual descriptions within large-scale 3D scenes presents inherent ambiguities, such as identifying all traffic lights in a city. Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts. Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning. We validate our method's superiority by comparing it against standard distribution estimation methods across five large-scale datasets, demonstrating consistent outperformance. Code, datasets and more information will be publicly available at our project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01157v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on differentiable scene representations is consistently moving towards more efficient, real-time models. Recently, this has led to the popularization of splatting methods, which eschew the traditional ray-based rendering of radiance fields in favor of rasterization. This has yielded a significant improvement in rendering speeds due to the efficiency of rasterization algorithms and hardware, but has come at a cost: the approximations that make rasterization efficient also make implementation of light transport phenomena like reflection and refraction much more difficult. We propose a novel scene representation which avoids these approximations, but keeps the efficiency and reconstruction quality of splatting by leveraging a decades-old efficient volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm which has been largely overlooked in recent computer vision research. The resulting model, which we name Radiant Foam, achieves rendering speed and quality comparable to Gaussian Splatting, without the constraints of rasterization. Unlike ray traced Gaussian models that use hardware ray tracing acceleration, our method requires no special hardware or APIs beyond the standard features of a programmable GPU.</p></details> |  |

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619v3)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |

However, since it is typically trained on only a short video that lacks the diversity in facial emotions, the resultant talking heads struggle to represent a wide range of emotions. To address this issue, we propose a lip-aligned emotional face generator and leverage it to train our EmoTalkingGaussian model. It is able to manipulate facial emotions conditioned on continuous emotion values (i.e., valence and arousal); while retaining synchronization of lip movements with input audio. Additionally, to achieve the accurate lip synchronization for in-the-wild audio, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that leverages a text-to-speech network and a visual-audio synchronization network. We experiment our EmoTalkingGaussian on publicly available videos and have obtained better results than state-of-the-arts in terms of image quality (measured in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), emotion expression (measured in V-RMSE, A-RMSE, V-SA, A-SA, Emotion Accuracy), and lip synchronization (measured in LMD, Sync-E, Sync-C), respectively.</p></details> | 22 pages |

In this paper, we unveil a fresh approach that blends state-space modeling with Wasserstein geometry, paving the way for a more fluid and coherent representation of dynamic scenes. We introduce a State Consistency Filter that merges prior predictions with the current observations, enabling Gaussians to stay true to their way over time. We also employ Wasserstein distance regularization to ensure smooth, consistent updates of Gaussian parameters, reducing motion artifacts. Lastly, we leverage Wasserstein geometry to capture both translational motion and shape deformations, creating a more physically plausible model for dynamic scenes. Our approach guides Gaussians along their natural way in the Wasserstein space, achieving smoother, more realistic motion and stronger temporal coherence. Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality and efficiency, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website https://weichengtseng.github.io/gs-granular-mani/</p></details> |

Recently, 3DGS Fields have emerged as a highly efficient and explicit alternative to Neural Field-based methods for high-quality Novel View Synthesis. Our 3D instance segmentation method directly lifts 2D segmentation masks from SAM (alternately FastSAM, etc.), together with features from CLIP and DINOv2, directly fusing them onto 3DGS (or similar Gaussian radiance fields such as 2DGS). Unlike previous approaches, LBG requires no per-scene training, allowing it to operate seamlessly on any existing 3DGS reconstruction. Our approach is not only an order of magnitude faster and simpler than existing approaches; it is also highly modular, enabling 3D semantic segmentation of existing 3DGS fields without requiring a specific parametrization of the 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, our technique achieves superior semantic segmentation for 2D semantic novel view synthesis and 3D asset extraction results while maintaining flexibility and efficiency. We further introduce a novel approach to evaluate individually segmented 3D assets from 3D radiance field segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

While recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved SLAM with high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering, these systems struggle with accurate depth and surface reconstruction due to multi-view inconsistencies. Simply incorporating SLAM and 3DGS leads to mismatches between the reconstructed frames. In this work, we present Endo-2DTAM, a real-time endoscopic SLAM system with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) to address these challenges. Endo-2DTAM incorporates a surface normal-aware pipeline, which consists of tracking, mapping, and bundle adjustment modules for geometrically accurate reconstruction. Our robust tracking module combines point-to-point and point-to-plane distance metrics, while the mapping module utilizes normal consistency and depth distortion to enhance surface reconstruction quality. We also introduce a pose-consistent strategy for efficient and geometrically coherent keyframe sampling. Extensive experiments on public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo-2DTAM achieves an RMSE of $1.87\pm 0.63$ mm for depth reconstruction of surgical scenes while maintaining computationally efficient tracking, high-quality visual appearance, and real-time rendering.

This representation offers numerous advantages, including rapid training and rendering. However, a significant limitation of 3DGS is the challenge of incorporating light and shadow reflections, primarily due to the utilization of rasterization rather than ray tracing for rendering. This paper introduces RaySplats, a model that employs ray-tracing based Gaussian Splatting. Rather than utilizing the projection of Gaussians, our method employs a ray-tracing mechanism, operating directly on Gaussian primitives represented by confidence ellipses with RGB colors. In practice, we compute the intersection between ellipses and rays to construct ray-tracing algorithms, facilitating the incorporation of meshes with Gaussian Splatting models and the addition of lights, shadows, and other related effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[VoD-3DGS: View-opacity-Dependent 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17978v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a 3D scene from images is challenging due to the different ways light interacts with surfaces depending on the viewer's position and the surface's material. In classical computer graphics, materials can be classified as diffuse or specular, interacting with light differently. The standard 3D Gaussian Splatting model struggles to represent view-dependent content, since it cannot differentiate an object within the scene from the light interacting with its specular surfaces, which produce highlights or reflections. In this paper, we propose to extend the 3D Gaussian Splatting model by introducing an additional symmetric matrix to enhance the opacity representation of each 3D Gaussian. This improvement allows certain Gaussians to be suppressed based on the viewer's perspective, resulting in a more accurate representation of view-dependent reflections and specular highlights without compromising the scene's integrity. By allowing the opacity to be view dependent, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mip-Nerf, Tanks&Temples, Deep Blending, and Nerf-Synthetic datasets without a significant loss in rendering speed, achieving >60FPS, and only incurring a minimal increase in memory used.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, considering the requirements of interactive and rendering applications, it is essential to achieve real-time rendering and driveability of the digital model without compromising rendering quality. Thus, we propose Jointly 3D Gaussian Hand (JGHand), a novel joint-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based hand representation that renders high-fidelity hand images in real-time for various poses and characters. Distinct from existing articulated neural rendering techniques, we introduce a differentiable process for spatial transformations based on 3D key points. This process supports deformations from the canonical template to a mesh with arbitrary bone lengths and poses. Additionally, we propose a real-time shadow simulation method based on per-pixel depth to simulate self-occlusion shadows caused by finger movements. Finally, we embed the hand prior and propose an animatable 3DGS representation of the hand driven solely by 3D key points. We validate the effectiveness of each component of our approach through comprehensive ablation studies. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that JGHand achieves real-time rendering speeds with enhanced quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

On these devices, memory is often limited in capacity and its access often dominates the consumption of compute energy. Although Gaussian Splatting (GS) allows for high-fidelity reconstruction of 3D scenes, current GS-based SLAM is not memory efficient as a large number of past images is stored to retrain Gaussians for reducing catastrophic forgetting. These images often require two-orders-of-magnitude higher memory than the map itself and thus dominate the total memory usage. In this work, we present GEVO, a GS-based monocular SLAM framework that achieves comparable fidelity as prior methods by rendering (instead of storing) them from the existing map. Novel Gaussian initialization and optimization techniques are proposed to remove artifacts from the map and delay the degradation of the rendered images over time. Across a variety of environments, GEVO achieves comparable map fidelity while reducing the memory overhead to around 58 MBs, which is up to 94x lower than prior works.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, neither the centers nor surfaces of the Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their direct use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically produces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage requirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates an additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape feature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric accuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural entropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for the geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as 'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU benchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and artifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency, evaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is monitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement in geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses floater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality. The geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest geometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces floater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most. This makes FeatureGS a strong method for geometrically accurate, artifact-reduced and memory-efficient 3D scene reconstruction, enabling the direct use of Gaussian centers for geometric representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

To this end, Levels of Detail (LOD) avatar representations such as polygonal meshes, image-based impostors, and point clouds have been proposed and evaluated. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been explored as a potential method for real-time crowd rendering. In this paper, we present a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment that aims to determine the perceived quality of 3D Gaussian avatars. Three factors were explored: Motion, LOD (i.e., #Gaussians), and the avatar height in Pixels (corresponding to the viewing distance). Participants viewed pairs of animated 3D Gaussian avatars and were tasked with choosing the most detailed one. Our findings can inform the optimization of LOD strategies in Gaussian-based crowd rendering, thereby helping to achieve efficient rendering while maintaining visual quality in real-time applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce DiffSplat, a novel 3D generative framework that natively generates 3D Gaussian splats by taming large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. It differs from previous 3D generative models by effectively utilizing web-scale 2D priors while maintaining 3D consistency in a unified model. To bootstrap the training, a lightweight reconstruction model is proposed to instantly produce multi-view Gaussian splat grids for scalable dataset curation. In conjunction with the regular diffusion loss on these grids, a 3D rendering loss is introduced to facilitate 3D coherence across arbitrary views. The compatibility with image diffusion models enables seamless adaptions of numerous techniques for image generation to the 3D realm. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of DiffSplat in text- and image-conditioned generation tasks and downstream applications. Thorough ablation studies validate the efficacy of each critical design choice and provide insights into the underlying mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025; Project page: https://chenguolin.github.io/projects/DiffSplat</p></details> |
| **[Deformable Beta Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18630v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced radiance field reconstruction by enabling real-time rendering. However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-based methods. Notably, for the first time, splatting-based methods outperform state-of-the-art Neural Radiance Fields, highlighting the superior performance and efficiency of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEP-GS: Perceptually-Enhanced Precise Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05731v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture specular highlights and anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects and specular highlights. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects, specular reflections, and fine-scale details.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DGS$^2$: Near Second-order Converging 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13975v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a collection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with superior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt with the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at most linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes, even with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order convergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our approach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a Gaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which endorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by splitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes, analytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group, and efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like convergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second, kernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This property allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate overshoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than standard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\times$ fewer iterations while maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based 3DGS reconstructions.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality 3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5figures |

To this end, existing approaches utilize vector quantization (VQ) to project pixels onto a discrete codebook and reconstruct images from the discrete representation. However, compared with the continuous latent space, the limited discrete codebook space significantly restrict the representational ability of these image tokenizers. In this paper, we propose GaussianToken: An Effective Image Tokenizer with 2D Gaussian Splatting as a solution. We first represent the encoded samples as multiple flexible featured 2D Gaussians characterized by positions, rotation angles, scaling factors, and feature coefficients. We adopt the standard quantization for the Gaussian features and then concatenate the quantization results with the other intrinsic Gaussian parameters before the corresponding splatting operation and the subsequent decoding module. In general, GaussianToken integrates the local influence of 2D Gaussian distribution into the discrete space and thus enhances the representation capability of the image tokenizer. Competitive reconstruction performances on CIFAR, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

However, 3DGS training requires a known camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Pioneering works have attempted to relax this restriction but still face difficulties when handling long sequences with complex camera trajectories. In this work, we propose Rob-GS, a robust framework to progressively estimate camera poses and optimize 3DGS for arbitrarily long video sequences. Leveraging the inherent continuity of videos, we design an adjacent pose tracking method to ensure stable pose estimation between consecutive frames. To handle arbitrarily long inputs, we adopt a "divide and conquer" scheme that adaptively splits the video sequence into several segments and optimizes them separately. Extensive experiments on the Tanks and Temples dataset and our collected real-world dataset show that our Rob-GS outperforms the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, GS-based reconstructions generally consist of millions of Gaussians, which makes them hard to use on computationally constrained devices such as smartphones. In this paper, we first propose a principled analysis of advances in efficient GS methods. Then, we propose Trick-GS, which is a careful combination of several strategies including (1) progressive training with resolution, noise and Gaussian scales, (2) learning to prune and mask primitives and SH bands by their significance, and (3) accelerated GS training framework. Trick-GS takes a large step towards resource-constrained GS, where faster run-time, smaller and faster-convergence of models is of paramount concern. Our results on three datasets show that Trick-GS achieves up to 2x faster training, 40x smaller disk size and 2x faster rendering speed compared to vanilla GS, while having comparable accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP'25</p></details> |

While such sanitized conditions simplify evaluation, they fail to capture the unpredictable, noisy complexities of real-world environments. Dynamic motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization perturbations lead to sharp performance declines when these models are deployed in practice, revealing an urgent need for frameworks that embrace and excel under real-world noise. To bridge this gap, we tackle three core challenges: scalable data generation, comprehensive benchmarking, and model robustness enhancement. First, we introduce a scalable noisy data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse datasets simulating complex motion, sensor imperfections, and synchronization errors. Second, we leverage this pipeline to create Robust-Ego3D, a benchmark rigorously designed to expose noise-induced performance degradation, highlighting the limitations of current learning-based methods in ego-motion accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Third, we propose Correspondence-guided Gaussian Splatting (CorrGS), a novel test-time adaptation method that progressively refines an internal clean 3D representation by aligning noisy observations with rendered RGB-D frames from clean 3D map, enhancing geometric alignment and appearance restoration through visual correspondence. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that CorrGS consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios involving rapid motion and dynamic illumination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025; 92 Pages; Project Repo: https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/SLAM-under-Perturbation. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.16850</p></details> |

Sparse keypoint matching, which traditional SfM methods often rely on, limits both accuracy and point density, especially in texture-less areas. Dense-SfM addresses this limitation by integrating dense matching with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based track extension which gives more consistent, longer feature tracks. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, Dense-SfM is equipped with a multi-view kernelized matching module leveraging transformer and Gaussian Process architectures, for robust track refinement across multi-views.

However, efficient real-time map reconstruction with data streamed from multiple robots and devices remains a challenge. To that end, we propose HAMMER, a server-based collaborative Gaussian Splatting method that leverages widely available ROS communication infrastructure to generate 3D, metric-semantic maps from asynchronous robot data-streams with no prior knowledge of initial robot positions and varying on-device pose estimators. HAMMER consists of (i) a frame alignment module that transforms local SLAM poses and image data into a global frame and requires no prior relative pose knowledge, and (ii) an online module for training semantic 3DGS maps from streaming data. HAMMER handles mixed perception modes, adjusts automatically for variations in image pre-processing among different devices, and distills CLIP semantic codes into the 3D scene for open-vocabulary language queries. In our real-world experiments, HAMMER creates higher-fidelity maps (2x) compared to competing baselines and is useful for downstream tasks, such as semantic goal-conditioned navigation (e.g., ``go to the couch").

The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/3DGSR.</p></details> |  |

However, it typically requires large storage capacity and high VRAM, demanding the design of effective pruning and compression techniques. Existing methods, while effective in some scenarios, struggle with scalability and fail to adapt models based on critical factors such as computing capabilities or bandwidth, requiring to re-train the model under different configurations. In this work, we propose a novel, model-agnostic technique that organizes Gaussians into several hierarchical layers, enabling progressive Level of Detail (LoD) strategy. This method, combined with recent approach of compression of 3DGS, allows a single model to instantly scale across several compression ratios, with minimal to none impact to quality compared to a single non-scalable model and without requiring re-training. We validate our approach on typical datasets and benchmarks, showcasing low distortion and substantial gains in terms of scalability and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

These point clouds are placed in the 3D bounding boxes and initialized into 3D Gaussian Splatting with concept labels, enabling precise identification of concept attributions in 2D projections. Finally, we refine 3D Gaussians via concept-aware interval score matching, guided by concept-aware diffusion. Our experimental results show that MultiDreamer3D not only ensures object presence and preserves the distinct identities of each concept but also successfully handles complex cases such as property change or interaction. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the multi-concept customization in 3D.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS.

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements. This proposal not only enhances the performance of Gaussian Splatting SLAM beyond room-scale scenarios but also achieves SLAM performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in large-scale indoor environments.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, its high storage requirements pose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians represent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush strokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we propose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using parametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians undergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain volumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware approach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene, our model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore using 2D Gaussian splats as a new primitive for representing videos. We propose GSVC, an approach to learning a set of 2D Gaussian splats that can effectively represent and compress video frames. GSVC incorporates the following techniques: (i) To exploit temporal redundancy among adjacent frames, which can speed up training and improve the compression efficiency, we predict the Gaussian splats of a frame based on its previous frame; (ii) To control the trade-offs between file size and quality, we remove Gaussian splats with low contribution to the video quality; (iii) To capture dynamics in videos, we randomly add Gaussian splats to fit content with large motion or newly-appeared objects; (iv) To handle significant changes in the scene, we detect key frames based on loss differences during the learning process. Experiment results show that GSVC achieves good rate-distortion trade-offs, comparable to state-of-the-art video codecs such as AV1 and VVC, and a rendering speed of 1500 fps for a 1920x1080 video.</p></details> |  |

However, its splatting-based rendering model makes several approximations to the rendering equation, reducing physical accuracy. We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary, even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically-accurate alpha values than 3DGS, which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray-tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.</p></details> |  |

These methods commonly resort to using exponential family functions, such as the Gaussian function, as reconstruction kernels due to their anisotropic nature, ease of projection, and differentiability in rasterization. However, the field remains restricted to variations within the exponential family, leaving generalized reconstruction kernels largely underexplored, partly due to the lack of easy integrability in 3D to 2D projections. In this light, we show that a class of decaying anisotropic radial basis functions (DARBFs), which are non-negative functions of the Mahalanobis distance, supports splatting by approximating the Gaussian function's closed-form integration advantage. With this fresh perspective, we demonstrate up to 34% faster convergence during training and a 15% reduction in memory consumption across various DARB reconstruction kernels, while maintaining comparable PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS results. We will make the code available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to the project page: https://randomnerds.github.io/darbs.github.io/</p></details> |

The key challenge of this task is learning a robust 3D-aware representation without multi-view or dynamic data, while ensuring consistent texture and geometry across different viewpoints. Although some baseline methods are capable of 3D-aware generation, the quality of the generated images still lags behind state-of-the-art 2D generation approaches, which excel in producing high-quality, detailed images. To address this severe limitation, we propose a novel feed-forward pipeline based on pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting, coined as F3D-Gaus, which can produce more realistic and reliable 3D renderings from monocular inputs. In addition, we introduce a self-supervised cycle-consistent constraint to enforce cross-view consistency in the learned 3D representation. This training strategy naturally allows aggregation of multiple aligned Gaussian primitives and significantly alleviates the interpolation limitations inherent in single-view pixel-aligned Gaussian Splatting. Furthermore, we incorporate video model priors to perform geometry-aware refinement, enhancing the generation of fine details in wide-viewpoint scenarios and improving the model's capability to capture intricate 3D textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high-quality, multi-view consistent 3D-aware generation from monocular datasets, but also significantly improves training and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://w-ted.github.io/publications/F3D-Gaus</p></details> |

However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the reconstruction and rendering quality. Although NeRF-based dehazing reconstruction algorithms have been developed, their use of deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Moreover, NeRF's implicit representation struggles to recover fine details from hazy scenes. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction by explicitly modeling point clouds into 3D Gaussians. In this paper, we propose leveraging the explicit Gaussian representation to explain the foggy image formation process through a physically accurate forward rendering process. We introduce DehazeGS, a method capable of decomposing and rendering a fog-free background from participating media using only muti-view foggy images as input. We model the transmission within each Gaussian distribution to simulate the formation of fog. During this process, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficient while optimizing the Gaussian representation of the hazy scene. In the inference stage, we eliminate the effects of scattering and attenuation on the Gaussians and directly project them onto a 2D plane to obtain a clear view. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both rendering quality and computational efficiency. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,4 figures. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper introduces IOVS4NeRF, a framework that employs an uncertainty-guided incremental optimal view selection strategy adaptable to various NeRF implementations. Specifically, by leveraging a hybrid uncertainty model that combines rendering and positional uncertainties, the proposed method calculates the most informative view from among the candidates, thereby enabling incremental optimization of scene reconstruction. Our detailed experiments demonstrate that IOVS4NeRF achieves high-fidelity NeRF reconstruction with minimal computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale scene applications.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.</p></details> | Under review |

In recent years, 3D object generation has made great process and achieved promising results, but it remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of generating complex, textured, and high-fidelity results. To resolve this problem, we study learning effective NeRFs and SDFs representations with 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for 3D object generation. Specifically, inspired by recent works, we use the efficient geometry-aware 3D GANs as the backbone incorporating with label embedding and color mapping, which enables to train the model on different taxonomies simultaneously. Then, through a decoder, we aggregate the resulting features to generate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) based representations for rendering high-fidelity synthetic images. Meanwhile, we optimize Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) to effectively represent objects with 3D meshes. Besides, we observe that this model can be effectively trained with only a few images of each object from a variety of classes, instead of using a great number of images per object or training one model per class. With this pipeline, we can optimize an effective model for 3D object generation. This solution is among the top 3 in the ICCV 2023 OmniObject3D Challenge.</p></details> |  |

Especially, we argue that latent codes stored in many NeRF SLAM systems are not fully exploited, as they are only used for better reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective way to detect potential loops using the same latent codes as local features. To further improve the loop detection performance, we use the semantic information, which are also decoded from the same latent codes to guide the aggregation of local features. Finally, with the potential loops detected, we close them with a graph optimization followed by bundle adjustment to refine both the estimated poses and the reconstructed scene. To evaluate the performance of our SLC$^2$-SLAM, we conduct extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet datasets. Our proposed semantic-guided loop closure significantly outperforms the pre-trained NetVLAD and ORB combined with Bag-of-Words, which are used in all the other NeRF SLAM with loop closure. As a result, our SLC$^2$-SLAM also demonstrated better tracking and reconstruction performance, especially in larger scenes with more loops, like ScanNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The potential applications of NVS, such as high-quality virtual and augmented reality, detailed 3D modeling, and realistic medical organ imaging, underscore the importance of quality assessment of NVS methods from the perspective of human perception. Although some previous studies have explored subjective quality assessments for NVS technology, they still face several challenges, especially in NVS methods selection, scenario coverage, and evaluation methodology. To address these challenges, we conducted two subjective experiments for the quality assessment of NVS technologies containing both GS-based and NeRF-based methods, focusing on dynamic and real-world scenes. This study covers 360{\deg}, front-facing, and single-viewpoint videos while providing a richer and greater number of real scenes. Meanwhile, it's the first time to explore the impact of NVS methods in dynamic scenes with moving objects. The two types of subjective experiments help to fully comprehend the influences of different viewing paths from a human perception perspective and pave the way for future development of full-reference and no-reference quality metrics. In addition, we established a comprehensive benchmark of various state-of-the-art objective metrics on the proposed database, highlighting that existing methods still struggle to accurately capture subjective quality. The results give us some insights into the limitations of existing NVS methods and may promote the development of new NVS methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[UV-Attack: Physical-World Adversarial Attacks for Person Detection via Dynamic-NeRF-based UV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05783v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or static 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success rates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings. This work highlights the potential of dynamic NeRF-based UV mapping for creating more effective adversarial attacks on person detectors, addressing key challenges in modeling human movement and texture modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 22 figures, submitted to ICLR2025</p></details> |
| **[EndoPerfect: A Hybrid NeRF-Stereo Vision Approach Pioneering Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D Reconstruction in Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04041v4)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) demands exceptional accuracy, with the mean error and standard deviation necessitating within the range of a single CT slice (0.625 mm), as the critical structures in the nasal cavity are situated within submillimeter distances from surgical instruments. This poses a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular endoscopes. Depth estimation is crucial for 3D reconstruction, yet existing depth estimation methodologies either suffer from inherent accuracy limitations or, in the case of learning-based approaches, perform poorly when applied to ESS despite succeeding on their original datasets. In this study, we present a novel, highly generalizable method that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and stereo depth estimation for 3D reconstruction that can derive metric monocular depth. Our approach begins with an initial NeRF reconstruction yielding a coarse 3D scene, the subsequent creation of binocular pairs within coarse 3D scene, and generation of depth maps through stereo vision, These depth maps are used to supervise subsequent NeRF iteration, progressively refining NeRF and binocular depth, the refinement process continues until the depth maps converged. This recursive process generates high-accuracy depth maps from monocular endoscopic video. Evaluation in synthetic endoscopy shows a depth accuracy of 0.125 $\pm$ 0.443 mm, well within the 0.625 mm threshold. Further clinical experiments with real endoscopic data demonstrate a mean distance to CT mesh of 0.269 mm, representing the highest accuracy among monocular 3D reconstruction methods in ESS.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRFs are Mirror Detectors: Using Structural Similarity for Multi-View Mirror Scene Reconstruction with 3D Surface Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04074v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While neural radiance fields (NeRF) led to a breakthrough in photorealistic novel view synthesis, handling mirroring surfaces still denotes a particular challenge as they introduce severe inconsistencies in the scene representation. Previous attempts either focus on reconstructing single reflective objects or rely on strong supervision guidance in terms of additional user-provided annotations of visible image regions of the mirrors, thereby limiting the practical usability. In contrast, in this paper, we present NeRF-MD, a method which shows that NeRFs can be considered as mirror detectors and which is capable of reconstructing neural radiance fields of scenes containing mirroring surfaces without the need for prior annotations. To this end, we first compute an initial estimate of the scene geometry by training a standard NeRF using a depth reprojection loss. Our key insight lies in the fact that parts of the scene corresponding to a mirroring surface will still exhibit a significant photometric inconsistency, whereas the remaining parts are already reconstructed in a plausible manner. This allows us to detect mirror surfaces by fitting geometric primitives to such inconsistent regions in this initial stage of the training. Using this information, we then jointly optimize the radiance field and mirror geometry in a second training stage to refine their quality. We demonstrate the capability of our method to allow the faithful detection of mirrors in the scene as well as the reconstruction of a single consistent scene representation, and demonstrate its potential in comparison to baseline and mirror-aware approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian NeRF: Quantifying Uncertainty with Volume Density for Neural Implicit Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06727v2)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which explicitly quantifies uncertainty in the volume density by modeling uncertainty in the occupancy, without the need for additional networks, making it particularly suited for challenging observations and uncontrolled image environments. NeRF diverges from traditional geometric methods by providing an enriched scene representation, rendering color and density in 3D space from various viewpoints. However, NeRF encounters limitations in addressing uncertainties solely through geometric structure information, leading to inaccuracies when interpreting scenes with insufficient real-world observations. While previous efforts have relied on auxiliary networks, we propose a series of formulation extensions to NeRF that manage uncertainties in density, both color and density, and occupancy, all without the need for additional networks. In experiments, we show that our method significantly enhances performance on RGB and depth images in the comprehensive dataset. Given that uncertainty modeling aligns well with the inherently uncertain environments of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we applied our approach to SLAM systems and observed notable improvements in mapping and tracking performance. These results confirm the effectiveness of our Bayesian NeRF approach in quantifying uncertainty based on geometric structure, making it a robust solution for challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Previous works (e.g, NeRF-Det) have demonstrated that implicit representation has the capacity to benefit the visual 3D perception task in indoor scenes with high amount of overlap between input images. However, previous works cannot fully utilize the advancement of implicit representation because of fixed sampling and simple multi-view feature fusion. In this paper, inspired by sparse fashion method (e.g, DETR3D), we propose a simple yet effective method, NeRF-DetS, to address above issues. NeRF-DetS includes two modules: Progressive Adaptive Sampling Strategy (PASS) and Depth-Guided Simplified Multi-Head Attention Fusion (DS-MHA). Specifically, (1)PASS can automatically sample features of each layer within a dense 3D detector, using offsets predicted by the previous layer. (2)DS-MHA can not only efficiently fuse multi-view features with strong occlusion awareness but also reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 dataset demonstrate our NeRF-DetS outperforms NeRF-Det, by achieving +5.02% and +5.92% improvement in mAP under IoU25 and IoU50, respectively. Also, NeRF-DetS shows consistent improvements on ARKITScenes.</p></details> |  |

We propose that identifying and establishing fine-grained and generalizable correspondences between driving signals and generated results can simultaneously resolve both problems. Here we present LokiTalk, a novel framework designed to enhance NeRF-based talking heads with lifelike facial dynamics and improved training efficiency. To achieve fine-grained correspondences, we introduce Region-Specific Deformation Fields, which decompose the overall portrait motion into lip movements, eye blinking, head pose, and torso movements. By hierarchically modeling the driving signals and their associated regions through two cascaded deformation fields, we significantly improve dynamic accuracy and minimize synthetic artifacts. Furthermore, we propose ID-Aware Knowledge Transfer, a plug-and-play module that learns generalizable dynamic and static correspondences from multi-identity videos, while simultaneously extracting ID-specific dynamic and static features to refine the depiction of individual characters. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LokiTalk delivers superior high-fidelity results and training efficiency compared to previous methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/LokiTalk/</p></details> |

These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds. Our code will be made publically available.</p></details> |  |

While adversarial vulnerabilities in 2D vision models have been extensively studied, the threat landscape for 3D generative models, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), remains underexplored. This work introduces \textit{AdvIRL}, a novel framework for crafting adversarial NeRF models using Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (Instant-NGP) and Reinforcement Learning. Unlike prior methods, \textit{AdvIRL} generates adversarial noise that remains robust under diverse 3D transformations, including rotations and scaling, enabling effective black-box attacks in real-world scenarios. Our approach is validated across a wide range of scenes, from small objects (e.g., bananas) to large environments (e.g., lighthouses). Notably, targeted attacks achieved high-confidence misclassifications, such as labeling a banana as a slug and a truck as a cannon, demonstrating the practical risks posed by adversarial NeRFs. Beyond attacking, \textit{AdvIRL}-generated adversarial models can serve as adversarial training data to enhance the robustness of vision systems.

However, the substantial data volumes pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. Existing solutions typically optimize NeRF representation and compression independently or focus on a single fixed rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff. In this paper, we propose VRVVC, a novel end-to-end joint optimization variable-rate framework for volumetric video compression that achieves variable bitrates using a single model while maintaining superior RD performance. Specifically, VRVVC introduces a compact tri-plane implicit residual representation for inter-frame modeling of long-duration dynamic scenes, effectively reducing temporal redundancy. We further propose a variable-rate residual representation compression scheme that leverages a learnable quantization and a tiny MLP-based entropy model. This approach enables variable bitrates through the utilization of predefined Lagrange multipliers to manage the quantization error of all latent representations. Finally, we present an end-to-end progressive training strategy combined with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRVVC achieves a wide range of variable bitrates within a single model and surpasses the RD performance of existing methods across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF-NQA: No-Reference Quality Assessment for Scenes Generated by NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08029v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural View Synthesis (NVS) has demonstrated efficacy in generating high-fidelity dense viewpoint videos using a image set with sparse views. However, existing quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS are not tailored for the scenes with dense viewpoints synthesized by NVS and NeRF variants, thus, they often fall short in capturing the perceptual quality, including spatial and angular aspects of NVS-synthesized scenes. Furthermore, the lack of dense ground truth views makes the full reference quality assessment on NVS-synthesized scenes challenging. For instance, datasets such as LLFF provide only sparse images, insufficient for complete full-reference assessments. To address the issues above, we propose NeRF-NQA, the first no-reference quality assessment method for densely-observed scenes synthesized from the NVS and NeRF variants. NeRF-NQA employs a joint quality assessment strategy, integrating both viewwise and pointwise approaches, to evaluate the quality of NVS-generated scenes. The viewwise approach assesses the spatial quality of each individual synthesized view and the overall inter-views consistency, while the pointwise approach focuses on the angular qualities of scene surface points and their compound inter-point quality. Extensive evaluations are conducted to compare NeRF-NQA with 23 mainstream visual quality assessment methods (from fields of image, video, and light-field assessment). The results demonstrate NeRF-NQA outperforms the existing assessment methods significantly and it shows substantial superiority on assessing NVS-synthesized scenes without references. An implementation of this paper are available at https://github.com/VincentQQu/NeRF-NQA.</p></details> |  |

While traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions.

The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions, although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improved training efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024 https://github.com/sbsws88/TFS-NeRF</p></details> |

However, these methods often yield suboptimal results due to their ineffective utilization of 2D diffusion priors. The limitations manifest in two critical aspects: the inadequate capture of geometric information by pretrained diffusion models and the suboptimal guidance provided by existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods. To address these problems, we introduce GB-NeRF, a novel framework that enhances NeRF inpainting through improved utilization of 2D diffusion priors. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: a fine-tuning strategy that simultaneously learns appearance and geometric priors and a specialized normal distillation loss that integrates these geometric priors into NeRF inpainting. We propose a technique called Balanced Score Distillation (BSD) that surpasses existing methods such as Score Distillation (SDS) and the improved version, Conditional Score Distillation (CSD). BSD offers improved inpainting quality in appearance and geometric aspects. Extensive experiments show that our method provides superior appearance fidelity and geometric consistency compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-language assistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[Towards Degradation-Robust Reconstruction in Generalizable NeRF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11691v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) across scenes has been proven to be an effective way to avoid per-scene optimization by representing a scene with deep image features of source images. However, despite its potential for real-world applications, there has been limited research on the robustness of GNeRFs to different types of degradation present in the source images. The lack of such research is primarily attributed to the absence of a large-scale dataset fit for training a degradation-robust generalizable NeRF model. To address this gap and facilitate investigations into the degradation robustness of 3D reconstruction tasks, we construct the Objaverse Blur Dataset, comprising 50,000 images from over 1000 settings featuring multiple levels of blur degradation. In addition, we design a simple and model-agnostic module for enhancing the degradation robustness of GNeRFs. Specifically, by extracting 3D-aware features through a lightweight depth estimator and denoiser, the proposed module shows improvement on different popular methods in GNeRFs in terms of both quantitative and visual quality over varying degradation types and levels. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing datasets such as Replica and ScanNet, we assess performance based on tracking accuracy, mapping fidelity, and view synthesis. Findings reveal that NeRF excels in view synthesis, offering unique capabilities in generating new perspectives from existing data, albeit at slower processing speeds. Conversely, Gaussian-based methods provide rapid processing and significant expressiveness but lack comprehensive scene completion. Enhanced by global optimization and loop closure techniques, newer methods like NICE-SLAM and SplaTAM not only surpass older frameworks such as ORB-SLAM2 in terms of robustness but also demonstrate superior performance in dynamic and complex environments. This comparative analysis bridges theoretical research with practical implications, shedding light on future developments in robust 3D scene reconstruction across various real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 6th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems</p></details> |

Building on disentangled Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations, our approach learns to map Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDF) from pairs of scenes observed in varying conditions, such as dry and wet. The learned transformations can then be applied to unseen scenes with similar materials, therefore effectively rendering the transformation learned with an arbitrary level of intensity. Extensive experiments on synthetic scenes and real-world objects validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it can learn various transformations such as wetness, painting, coating, etc. Our results highlight not only the versatility of our method but also its potential for practical applications in computer graphics. We publish our method implementation, along with our synthetic/real datasets on https://github.com/astra-vision/BRDFTransform</p></details> |  |
| **[LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06757v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable performances in producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

Traditional methods can be divided into two categories, one is absolute radiation correction and the other is relative radiation normalization. We propose a NeRF-based method of color consistency correction for multi-view images, which weaves image features together using implicit expressions, and then re-illuminates feature space to generate a fusion image with a new perspective. We chose Superview-1 satellite images and UAV images with large range and time difference for the experiment. Experimental results show that the synthesize image generated by our method has excellent visual effect and smooth color transition at the edges.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 4 figures, The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS2023)</p></details> |
| **[Rate-aware Compression for NeRF-based Volumetric Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05322v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, NeRF has demonstrated remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICME 2024</p></details> |

Currently, most NeRF methods either require accurate camera poses or a large number of input images, or even both. Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically, we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and fine-tuned as well. All training phases are in self-supervised manners. Comprehensive evaluations of synthetic and real images show that CAD-NeRF successfully learns accurate densities with a large deformation from retrieved CAD models, showing the generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal NeRF Self-Supervision for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02969v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR Semantic Segmentation is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception consisting of associating each LiDAR point to a semantic label. Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges. For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR Semantic Segmentation benchmarks: nuScenes, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024</p></details> |

However, to the best of our knowledge, existing works do not explicitly model the distribution of training camera poses, or consequently the triangulation quality, a key factor affecting reconstruction quality dating back to classical vision literature. We close this gap with ProvNeRF, an approach that models the \textbf{provenance} for each point -- i.e., the locations where it is likely visible -- of NeRFs as a stochastic field. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE) to functional space with an optimizable objective. We show that modeling per-point provenance during the NeRF optimization enriches the model with information on triangulation leading to improvements in novel view synthesis and uncertainty estimation under the challenging sparse, unconstrained view setting against competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Bringing NeRFs to the Latent Space: Inverse Graphics Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22936v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained image autoencoders are increasingly utilized in computer vision, the application of inverse graphics in 2D latent spaces has been under-explored. Yet, besides reducing the training and rendering complexity, applying inverse graphics in the latent space enables a valuable interoperability with other latent-based 2D methods. The major challenge is that inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces because they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To this end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its latent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained IG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline, which we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework, thereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We experimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved quality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and rendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

| **[Evaluation of strategies for efficient rate-distortion NeRF streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19459v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized the field of 3D visual representation by enabling highly realistic and detailed scene reconstructions from a sparse set of images. NeRF uses a volumetric functional representation that maps 3D points to their corresponding colors and opacities, allowing for photorealistic view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. Despite its advancements, the efficient streaming of NeRF content remains a significant challenge due to the large amount of data involved. This paper investigates the rate-distortion performance of two NeRF streaming strategies: pixel-based and neural network (NN) parameter-based streaming. While in the former, images are coded and then transmitted throughout the network, in the latter, the respective NeRF model parameters are coded and transmitted instead. This work also highlights the trade-offs in complexity and performance, demonstrating that the NN parameter-based strategy generally offers superior efficiency, making it suitable for one-to-many streaming scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This landscape is defined by a NeRF-informed grasp value function. The neural network representing this function is trained on simulated grasp demonstrations. During training, we use an auxiliary loss to guide not only the weight updates of this network but also the update how the slope of the optimization landscape changes. This loss is computed on the demonstrated grasp trajectory and the gradients of the landscape. With second order optimization, we incorporate valuable information from the trajectory as well as facilitate the optimization process of the implicit policy. Experiments demonstrate that employing this auxiliary loss improves policies' performance in simulation as well as their zero-shot transfer to the real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot NeRF by Adaptive Rendering Loss Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17839v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel view synthesis with sparse inputs poses great challenges to Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). Recent works demonstrate that the frequency regularization of Positional Encoding (PE) can achieve promising results for few-shot NeRF. In this work, we reveal that there exists an inconsistency between the frequency regularization of PE and rendering loss. This prevents few-shot NeRF from synthesizing higher-quality novel views. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose Adaptive Rendering loss regularization for few-shot NeRF, dubbed AR-NeRF. Specifically, we present a two-phase rendering supervision and an adaptive rendering loss weight learning strategy to align the frequency relationship between PE and 2D-pixel supervision. In this way, AR-NeRF can learn global structures better in the early training phase and adaptively learn local details throughout the training process. Extensive experiments show that our AR-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, including object-level and complex scenes.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |
| **[Visual Localization in 3D Maps: Comparing Point Cloud, Mesh, and NeRF Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11966v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in mapping techniques have enabled the creation of highly accurate dense 3D maps during robotic missions, such as point clouds, meshes, or NeRF-based representations. These developments present new opportunities for reusing these maps for localization. However, there remains a lack of a unified approach that can operate seamlessly across different map representations. This paper presents and evaluates a global visual localization system capable of localizing a single camera image across various 3D map representations built using both visual and lidar sensing. Our system generates a database by synthesizing novel views of the scene, creating RGB and depth image pairs. Leveraging the precise 3D geometric map, our method automatically defines rendering poses, reducing the number of database images while preserving retrieval performance. To bridge the domain gap between real query camera images and synthetic database images, our approach utilizes learning-based descriptors and feature detectors. We evaluate the system's performance through extensive real-world experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings, assessing the effectiveness of each map representation and demonstrating its advantages over traditional structure-from-motion (SfM) localization approaches. The results show that all three map representations can achieve consistent localization success rates of 55% and higher across various environments. NeRF synthesized images show superior performance, localizing query images at an average success rate of 72%. Furthermore, we demonstrate an advantage over SfM-based approaches that our synthesized database enables localization in the reverse travel direction which is unseen during the mapping process. Our system, operating in real-time on a mobile laptop equipped with a GPU, achieves a processing rate of 1Hz.</p></details> |  |

Previous works would address this issue by introducing new neural networks or data structures. In this work, We propose GL-NeRF, a new perspective of computing volume rendering with the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

One potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also produces sparse 3D points that can be used as "free" depth supervision during training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster. Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF methods, demonstrating that depth is a cheap and easily digestible supervisory signal. And finally, we find that DS-NeRF can support other types of depth supervision such as scanned depth sensors and RGB-D reconstruction outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dsnerf/ GitHub: https://github.com/dunbar12138/DSNeRF</p></details> |

When combined with human prior knowledge, high-quality human rendering can be achieved even with sparse input views. However, the inference of these methods is still slow, as a large number of neural network queries on each ray are required to ensure the rendering quality. Moreover, occluded regions often suffer from artifacts, especially when the input views are sparse. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable human NeRF framework that achieves high-quality and real-time rendering with sparse input views by extensively leveraging human prior knowledge. We accelerate the rendering with a two-stage sampling reduction strategy: first constructing boundary meshes around the human geometry to reduce the number of ray samples for sampling guidance regression, and then volume rendering using fewer guided samples. To improve rendering quality, especially in occluded regions, we propose an occlusion-aware attention mechanism to extract occlusion information from the human priors, followed by an image space refinement network to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, for volume rendering, we adopt a signed ray distance function (SRDF) formulation, which allows us to propose an SRDF loss at every sample position to improve the rendering quality further. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and has a competitive rendering speed compared with speed-prioritized novel view synthesis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://github.com/LarsPh/EG-HumanNeRF</p></details> |

Existing ISAR reconstruction methods including backprojection (BP) often require complex setups and controlled environments, rendering them impractical for many real-world noisy scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Analysis-through-Synthesis (ATS) framework enabled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for high-resolution coherent ISAR imaging of small objects using sparse and noisy Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radar data with an inexpensive and portable setup. Our end-to-end framework integrates ultra-wideband radar wave propagation, reflection characteristics, and scene priors, enabling efficient 2D scene reconstruction without the need for costly anechoic chambers or complex measurement test beds. With qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional techniques and generates ISAR images of complex scenes with multiple targets and complex structures in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) and noisy scenarios, particularly with limited number of views and sparse UWB radar scans. This work represents a significant step towards practical, cost-effective ISAR imaging of small everyday objects, with broad implications for robotics and mobile sensing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling.

Existing NeRFs are designed based on a key assumption that the target scene remains unchanged between the training and test time. However, small but unpredictable perturbations such as object movements, light changes and data contaminations broadly exist in real-life 3D scenes, which lead to significantly defective or failed rendering results even for the recent state-of-the-art generalizable methods. To address this, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework in OPONeRF that adaptively responds to local scene variations via personalizing appropriate point-wise parameters, instead of fitting a single set of NeRF parameters that are inactive to test-time unseen changes. Moreover, to explicitly capture the local uncertainty, we decompose the point representation into deterministic mapping and probabilistic inference. In this way, OPONeRF learns the sharable invariance and unsupervisedly models the unexpected scene variations between the training and testing scenes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we construct benchmarks from both realistic and synthetic data with diverse test-time perturbations including foreground motions, illumination variations and multi-modality noises, which are more challenging than conventional generalization and temporal reconstruction benchmarks. Experimental results show that our OPONeRF outperforms state-of-the-art NeRFs on various evaluation metrics through benchmark experiments and cross-scene evaluations. We further show the efficacy of the proposed method via experimenting on other existing generalization-based benchmarks and incorporating the idea of One-Point-One NeRF into other advanced baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and dataset: https://yzheng97.github.io/OPONeRF/</p></details> |

However, these methods face two primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks.

However, a collaborative approach requires a distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with less accurate relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

| **[Distributed NeRF Learning for Collaborative Multi-Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20289v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective environment perception is crucial for enabling downstream robotic applications. Individual robotic agents often face occlusion and limited visibility issues, whereas multi-agent systems can offer a more comprehensive mapping of the environment, quicker coverage, and increased fault tolerance. In this paper, we propose a collaborative multi-agent perception system where agents collectively learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) from posed RGB images to represent a scene. Each agent processes its local sensory data and shares only its learned NeRF model with other agents, reducing communication overhead. Given NeRF's low memory footprint, this approach is well-suited for robotic systems with limited bandwidth, where transmitting all raw data is impractical. Our distributed learning framework ensures consistency across agents' local NeRF models, enabling convergence to a unified scene representation. We show the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments on datasets containing challenging real-world scenes, achieving performance comparable to centralized mapping of the environment where data is sent to a central server for processing. Additionally, we find that multi-agent learning provides regularization benefits, improving geometric consistency in scenarios with sparse input views. We show that in such scenarios, multi-agent mapping can even outperform centralized training.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeRF View Synthesis: Subjective Quality Assessment and Objective Metrics Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints. This capability has significant advantages for applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling, and content creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics. This paper addresses the problem of NeRF view synthesis (NVS) quality assessment thoroughly, by conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several scene classes and recently proposed NVS methods. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. This study found that errors in camera pose estimation can result in spatial misalignments between synthesized and reference images, which need to be corrected before applying an objective quality metric. The experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation of several NVS methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and 360-degree camera trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deblur e-NeRF: NeRF from Motion-Blurred Events under High-speed or Low-light Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17988v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stark contrast in the design philosophy of an event camera makes it particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform. Nonetheless, event cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed and lighting conditions. We also introduce a novel threshold-normalized total variation loss to improve the regularization of large textureless patches. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, event simulator and synthetic event dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[CompoNeRF: Text-guided Multi-object Compositional NeRF with Editable 3D Scene Layout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13843v5)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D form plays a crucial role in creating editable 3D scenes for AR/VR. Recent advances have shown promise in merging neural radiance fields (NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However, one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of 'guidance collapse' and further enhance scene consistency, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object-specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a complex text into the layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next, a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts accuracy. Noticeably, our composition design permits decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open-source Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF generates multi-object scenes with high fidelity. Remarkably, our framework achieves up to a \textbf{54\%} improvement by the multi-view CLIP score metric. Our user study indicates that our method has significantly improved semantic accuracy, multi-view consistency, and individual recognizability for multi-object scene generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ternary-Type Opacity and Hybrid Odometry for RGB NeRF-SLAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13332v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the challenge of deploying Neural Radiance Field (NeRFs) in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) under the condition of lacking depth information, relying solely on RGB inputs. The key to unlocking the full potential of NeRF in such a challenging context lies in the integration of real-world priors. A crucial prior we explore is the binary opacity prior of 3D space with opaque objects. To effectively incorporate this prior into the NeRF framework, we introduce a ternary-type opacity (TT) model instead, which categorizes points on a ray intersecting a surface into three regions: before, on, and behind the surface. This enables a more accurate rendering of depth, subsequently improving the performance of image warping techniques. Therefore, we further propose a novel hybrid odometry (HO) scheme that merges bundle adjustment and warping-based localization. Our integrated approach of TT and HO achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, in terms of both speed and accuracy. This breakthrough underscores the potential of NeRF-SLAM in navigating complex environments with high fidelity.</p></details> | IROS 2024 |
| **[NeRF-Supervised Feature Point Detection and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08156v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instant Uncertainty Calibration of NeRFs Using a Meta-Calibrator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02350v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have markedly improved novel view synthesis, accurate uncertainty quantification in their image predictions remains an open problem. The prevailing methods for estimating uncertainty, including the state-of-the-art Density-aware NeRF Ensembles (DANE) [29], quantify uncertainty without calibration. This frequently leads to over- or under-confidence in image predictions, which can undermine their real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method which, for the first time, achieves calibrated uncertainties for NeRFs. To accomplish this, we overcome a significant challenge in adapting existing calibration techniques to NeRFs: a need to hold out ground truth images from the target scene, reducing the number of images left to train the NeRF. This issue is particularly problematic in sparse-view settings, where we can operate with as few as three images. To address this, we introduce the concept of a meta-calibrator that performs uncertainty calibration for NeRFs with a single forward pass without the need for holding out any images from the target scene. Our meta-calibrator is a neural network that takes as input the NeRF images and uncalibrated uncertainty maps and outputs a scene-specific calibration curve that corrects the NeRF's uncalibrated uncertainties. We show that the meta-calibrator can generalize on unseen scenes and achieves well-calibrated and state-of-the-art uncertainty for NeRFs, significantly beating DANE and other approaches. This opens opportunities to improve applications that rely on accurate NeRF uncertainty estimates such as next-best view planning and potentially more trustworthy image reconstruction for medical diagnosis.

Explicit NeRF models facilitate the practical NeRF applications with faster rendering speed, and also attract considerable attention in NeRF compression due to its huge storage cost. To address the challenge of the NeRF compression study, in this paper, we construct a new dataset, called Explicit-NeRF-QA. We use 22 3D objects with diverse geometries, textures, and material complexities to train four typical explicit NeRF models across five parameter levels. Lossy compression is introduced during the model generation, pivoting the selection of key parameters such as hash table size for InstantNGP and voxel grid resolution for Plenoxels. By rendering NeRF samples to processed video sequences (PVS), a large scale subjective experiment with lab environment is conducted to collect subjective scores from 21 viewers. The diversity of content, accuracy of mean opinion scores (MOS), and characteristics of NeRF distortion are comprehensively presented, establishing the heterogeneity of the proposed dataset. The state-of-the-art objective metrics are tested in the new dataset. Best Person correlation, which is around 0.85, is collected from the full-reference objective metric. All tested no-reference metrics report very poor results with 0.4 to 0.6 correlations, demonstrating the need for further development of more robust no-reference metrics. The dataset, including NeRF samples, source 3D objects, multiview images for NeRF generation, PVSs, MOS, is made publicly available at the following location: https://github.com/YukeXing/Explicit-NeRF-QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, conference</p></details> |

Recent approaches either struggle to preserve the speaker identity or fail to produce faithful facial expressions. To address these challenges, we propose a NeRF-based network. Since we train our network on monocular videos without any ground truth, it is essential to learn disentangled representations for audio and expression. We first learn audio features in a self-supervised manner, given utterances from multiple subjects. By incorporating a contrastive learning technique, we ensure that the learned audio features are aligned to the lip motion and disentangled from the muscle motion of the rest of the face. We then devise a transformer-based architecture that learns expression features, capturing long-range facial expressions and disentangling them from the speech-specific mouth movements. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity talking face videos, achieving state-of-the-art facial expression transfer along with lip synchronization to unseen audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024.

This constrained data requirement not only enhances rendering efficiency but also facilitates dynamic data fetching, thereby enabling a seamless 3D navigation experience for users. In this work, we extend this proven LoD technique to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by introducing an octree structure to represent the scenes in different scales. This innovative approach provides a mathematically simple and elegant representation with a rendering space complexity of O(log n), aligned with the efficiency of mesh-based LoD techniques. We also present a novel training strategy that maintains a complexity of O(n). This strategy allows for parallel training with minimal overhead, ensuring the scalability and efficiency of our proposed method. Our contribution is not only in extending the capabilities of existing techniques but also in establishing a foundation for scalable and efficient large-scale scene representation using NeRF and octree structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, version accepted by Siggraph Asia</p></details> |

In the case of MDE models for autonomous driving, this issue is exacerbated by the linearity of the captured data trajectories. We propose a NeRF-based data augmentation pipeline to introduce synthetic data with more diverse viewing directions into training datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our approach to model performance and robustness. Our data augmentation pipeline, which we call \textit{NeRFmentation}, trains NeRFs on each scene in a dataset, filters out subpar NeRFs based on relevant metrics, and uses them to generate synthetic RGB-D images captured from new viewing directions. In this work, we apply our technique in conjunction with three state-of-the-art MDE architectures on the popular autonomous driving dataset, KITTI, augmenting its training set of the Eigen split. We evaluate the resulting performance gain on the original test set, a separate popular driving dataset, and our own synthetic test set.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses key challenges in multi-robot 3D reconstruction, including inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. We introduce a method for using wireless Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and ranging measurements to estimate relative poses between robots, as well as quantifying and incorporating the uncertainty embedded in the wireless localization of these pose estimates into the NeRF training loss to mitigate the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Furthermore, we propose an active view selection approach that accounts for robot pose uncertainty when determining the next-best views to improve the 3D reconstruction, enabling faster convergence through intelligent view selection. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in theory and in practice. Leveraging wireless coordination and localization uncertainty-aware training, MULAN-WC can achieve high-quality 3d reconstruction which is close to applying the ground truth camera poses. Furthermore, the quantification of the information gain from a novel view enables consistent rendering quality improvement with incrementally captured images by commending the robot the novel view position. Our hardware experiments showcase the practicality of deploying MULAN-WC to real robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are trained to minimize the rendering loss of predicted viewpoints. However, the photometric loss often does not provide enough information to disambiguate between different possible geometries yielding the same image. Previous work has thus incorporated depth supervision during NeRF training, leveraging dense predictions from pre-trained depth networks as pseudo-ground truth. While these depth priors are assumed to be perfect once filtered for noise, in practice, their accuracy is more challenging to capture. This work proposes a novel approach to uncertainty in depth priors for NeRF supervision. Instead of using custom-trained depth or uncertainty priors, we use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. Because we know that depth priors are prone to errors, we propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution with Earth Mover's Distance instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the depth prior exactly through L2-loss. Our depth-guided NeRF outperforms all baselines on standard depth metrics by a large margin while maintaining performance on photometric measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, NeRF's dependence on extensive data collection, including sensitive scene image data, introduces significant privacy risks when users upload this data for model training. To address this concern, we first propose SplitNeRF, a training framework that incorporates split learning (SL) techniques to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training between clients and servers without sharing local data. Despite its benefits, we identify vulnerabilities in SplitNeRF by developing two attack methods, Surrogate Model Attack and Scene-aided Surrogate Model Attack, which exploit the shared gradient data and a few leaked scene images to reconstruct private scene information. To counter these threats, we introduce $S^2$NeRF, secure SplitNeRF that integrates effective defense mechanisms. By introducing decaying noise related to the gradient norm into the shared gradient information, $S^2$NeRF preserves privacy while maintaining a high utility of the NeRF model. Our extensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $S^2$NeRF against privacy breaches, confirming its viability for secure NeRF training in sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS'24), October 14-18, 2024, Salt Lake City, UT, USA</p></details> |

MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry. Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our method achieves SOTA performance.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which provide the current benchmark in terms of quality for the generation of novel views of complex 3D scenes from a limited set of 2D images, represent a promising solution to this challenge. However, the training of these models requires the knowledge of the respective camera positions from which the images were viewed. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by introducing HyperNeRFGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture employing a hypernetwork paradigm to transform a Gaussian noise into the weights of a NeRF architecture that does not utilize viewing directions in its training phase. Consequently, as evidenced by the findings of our experimental study, the proposed model, despite its notable simplicity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art alternatives, demonstrates superior performance on a diverse range of image datasets where camera position estimation is challenging, particularly in the context of medical data.</p></details> |  |

Recently, NeRF has been employed to enhance pose regression and scene coordinate regression models by augmenting the training database, providing auxiliary supervision through rendered images, or serving as an iterative refinement module. We extend its recognized advantages -- its ability to provide a compact scene representation with realistic appearances and accurate geometry -- by exploring the potential of NeRF's internal features in establishing precise 2D-3D matches for localization. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of NeRF's implicit knowledge, acquired through view synthesis, for matching under various conditions. This includes exploring different matching network architectures, extracting encoder features at multiple layers, and varying training configurations. Significantly, we introduce NeRFMatch, an advanced 2D-3D matching function that capitalizes on the internal knowledge of NeRF learned via view synthesis. Our evaluation of NeRFMatch on standard localization benchmarks, within a structure-based pipeline, sets a new state-of-the-art for localization performance on Cambridge Landmarks.</p></details> | ECCV24 camera ready |

Previous solutions for learning NeRFs with sparse views and noisy poses only consider local geometry consistency with pairs of views. Closely following \textit{bundle adjustment} in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), we introduce TrackNeRF for more globally consistent geometry reconstruction and more accurate pose optimization. TrackNeRF introduces \textit{feature tracks}, \ie connected pixel trajectories across \textit{all} visible views that correspond to the \textit{same} 3D points. By enforcing reprojection consistency among feature tracks, TrackNeRF encourages holistic 3D consistency explicitly. Through extensive experiments, TrackNeRF sets a new benchmark in noisy and sparse view reconstruction. In particular, TrackNeRF shows significant improvements over the state-of-the-art BARF and SPARF by $\sim8$ and $\sim1$ in terms of PSNR on DTU under various sparse and noisy view setups.

However, the occlusion of invisible voxels by scene surfaces poses challenges to current SSC methods in hallucinating refined 3D geometry. This paper proposes HybridOcc, a hybrid 3D volume query proposal method generated by Transformer framework and NeRF representation and refined in a coarse-to-fine SSC prediction framework. HybridOcc aggregates contextual features through the Transformer paradigm based on hybrid query proposals while combining it with NeRF representation to obtain depth supervision. The Transformer branch contains multiple scales and uses spatial cross-attention for 2D to 3D transformation. The newly designed NeRF branch implicitly infers scene occupancy through volume rendering, including visible and invisible voxels, and explicitly captures scene depth rather than generating RGB color. Furthermore, we present an innovative occupancy-aware ray sampling method to orient the SSC task instead of focusing on the scene surface, further improving the overall performance. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HybridOcc on the SSC task.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE RAL |

Obstacle detection, avoidance and path planning are critical safety-relevant tasks, which are often solved using expensive LiDAR sensors and depth cameras. We propose to use cost-effective low-resolution ranging sensors, such as ultrasonic and infrared time-of-flight sensors by developing VIRUS-NeRF - Vision, InfraRed, and UltraSonic based Neural Radiance Fields. Building upon Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding (Instant-NGP), VIRUS-NeRF incorporates depth measurements from ultrasonic and infrared sensors and utilizes them to update the occupancy grid used for ray marching. Experimental evaluation in 2D demonstrates that VIRUS-NeRF achieves comparable mapping performance to LiDAR point clouds regarding coverage. Notably, in small environments, its accuracy aligns with that of LiDAR measurements, while in larger ones, it is bounded by the utilized ultrasonic sensors. An in-depth ablation study reveals that adding ultrasonic and infrared sensors is highly effective when dealing with sparse data and low view variation. Further, the proposed occupancy grid of VIRUS-NeRF improves the mapping capabilities and increases the training speed by 46% compared to Instant-NGP.

| **[From NeRFs to Gaussian Splats, and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09717v3)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robotics applications where there is a limited number of (typically ego-centric) views, parametric representations such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) generalize better than non-parametric ones such as Gaussian splatting (GS) to views that are very different from those in the training data; GS however can render much faster than NeRFs. We develop a procedure to convert back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs (superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor compared to training the two from scratch.</p></details> |  |

However, they fail to reconstruct the dynamic scenes and struggle to fit even the training views in unsynchronized settings. It happens because they employ a single latent embedding for a frame while the multi-view images at the same frame were actually captured at different moments. To address this limitation, we introduce time offsets for individual unsynchronized videos and jointly optimize the offsets with NeRF. By design, our method is applicable for various baselines and improves them with large margins. Furthermore, finding the offsets naturally works as synchronizing the videos without manual effort. Experiments are conducted on the common Plenoptic Video Dataset and a newly built Unsynchronized Dynamic Blender Dataset to verify the performance of our method.

| **[3D Reconstruction of Protein Structures from Multi-view AFM Images using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06244v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning for predicting 3D protein structures have shown promise, particularly when leveraging inputs like protein sequences and Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) images. However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually fail to capture the complex geometric details of plants, which is crucial for phenotyping and breeding studies. We evaluate the reconstruction fidelity of NeRFs in three scenarios with increasing complexity and compare the results with the point cloud obtained using LiDAR as ground truth. In the most realistic field scenario, the NeRF models achieve a 74.6% F1 score after 30 minutes of training on the GPU, highlighting the efficacy of NeRFs for 3D reconstruction in challenging environments. Additionally, we propose an early stopping technique for NeRF training that almost halves the training time while achieving only a reduction of 7.4% in the average F1 score. This optimization process significantly enhances the speed and efficiency of 3D reconstruction using NeRFs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of NeRFs in detailed and realistic 3D plant reconstruction and suggest practical approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency of NeRFs in the 3D reconstruction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 'Plant Phenomics'</p></details> |

NeRF models produce state-of-the-art quality for many 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks but require substantial computational resources. The encoding of the scene information within the NeRF network parameters necessitates stochastic sampling. We observe that during the training, a major part of the compute time and memory usage is spent on processing already learnt samples, which no longer affect the model update significantly. We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph. As our method only interfaces with the network module, we expect it to be widely applicable.</p></details> |  |

While many works have focused on generating 3D human models, they suffer one or more of the following: lack of distinctive features, unnatural shading/shadows, unnatural poses/clothes, limited views, etc. InceptionHuman achieves consistent 3D human generation within a progressively refined NeRF space with two novel modules, Iterative Pose-Aware Refinement (IPAR) and Progressive-Augmented Reconstruction (PAR). IPAR iteratively refines the diffusion-generated images and synthesizes high-quality 3D-aware views considering the close-pose RGB values. PAR employs a pretrained diffusion prior to augment the generated synthetic views and adds regularization for view-independent appearance. Overall, the synthesis of photorealistic novel views empowers the resulting 3D human NeRF from 360-degree perspectives. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental comparison show that our InceptionHuman models achieve state-of-the-art application quality.</p></details> |  |

Although there are extensive works on image-level attacks, most are restricted to 2D pixel spaces, and such attacks are not always physically realistic in our 3D world. Here we present Adv3D, the first exploration of modeling adversarial examples as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Advances in NeRF provide photorealistic appearances and 3D accurate generation, yielding a more realistic and realizable adversarial example. We train our adversarial NeRF by minimizing the surrounding objects' confidence predicted by 3D detectors on the training set. Then we evaluate Adv3D on the unseen validation set and show that it can cause a large performance reduction when rendering NeRF in any sampled pose. To generate physically realizable adversarial examples, we propose primitive-aware sampling and semantic-guided regularization that enable 3D patch attacks with camouflage adversarial texture. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained adversarial NeRF generalizes well to different poses, scenes, and 3D detectors. Finally, we provide a defense method to our attacks that involves adversarial training through data augmentation. Project page: https://len-li.github.io/adv3d-web</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively. Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and low-light scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, extending these techniques to edit scenes in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is complex, as editing individual 2D frames can result in inconsistencies across multiple views. Our crucial insight is that a NeRF scene's geometry can serve as a bridge to integrate these 2D edits. Utilizing this geometry, we employ a depth-conditioned ControlNet to enhance the coherence of each 2D image modification. Moreover, we introduce an inpainting approach that leverages the depth information of NeRF scenes to distribute 2D edits across different images, ensuring robustness against errors and resampling challenges. Our results reveal that this methodology achieves more consistent, lifelike, and detailed edits than existing leading methods for text-driven NeRF scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D Sc...</summary><p>3D Scene Editing, Neural Rendering, Diffusion Models, Accepted to ECCV24</p></details> |

Traditionally, 3D mapping, or scene reconstruction, has relied on expensive LiDAR sensing. Photogrammetry can perform image-based 3D reconstruction but is computationally expensive and requires extremely dense image representation to recover complex geometry and photorealism. NeRFs perform 3D scene reconstruction by training a neural network on sparse image and pose data, achieving superior results to photogrammetry with less input data. This paper presents an evaluation of two NeRF scene reconstructions for the purpose of estimating the diameter of a vertical PVC cylinder. One of these are trained on commodity iPhone data and the other is trained on robot-sourced imagery and poses. This neural-geometry is compared to state-of-the-art lidar-inertial SLAM in terms of scene noise and metric-accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios.

Our key idea is to model the dynamic radiance field as a dynamic system whose temporally varying states are estimated based on two sources of knowledge: observations and predictions. We introduce a novel plug-in Kalman filter guided deformation field that enables accurate deformation estimation from scene observations and predictions. We use a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for observations and model the motion as locally linear to calculate predictions with motion equations. To further enhance the performance of the observation MLP, we introduce regularization in the canonical space to facilitate the network's ability to learn warping for different frames. Additionally, we employ an efficient tri-plane representation for encoding the canonical space, which has been experimentally demonstrated to converge quickly with high quality. This enables us to use a shallower observation MLP, consisting of just two layers in our implementation. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data and compare with past dynamic NeRF methods. Our KFD-NeRF demonstrates similar or even superior rendering performance within comparable computational time and achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis performance with thorough training.</p></details> | accepted to eccv2024 |

Following its success, many approaches proposed different NeRF representations in order to further improve both runtime and performance. One such example is Triplane, in which NeRF is represented using three 2D feature planes. This enables easily using existing 2D neural networks in this framework, e.g., to generate the three planes. Despite its advantage, the triplane representation lagged behind in its 3D recovery quality compared to NeRF solutions. In this work, we propose TriNeRFLet, a 2D wavelet-based multiscale triplane representation for NeRF, which closes the 3D recovery performance gap and is competitive with current state-of-the-art methods. Building upon the triplane framework, we also propose a novel super-resolution (SR) technique that combines a diffusion model with TriNeRFLet for improving NeRF resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Rather than developing hard-to-combine and specific modules, another approach generally overlooked is to directly inject generic priors on the scene representation (also called inductive biases) into the NeRF architecture. Based on this idea, we propose the RING-NeRF architecture which includes two inductive biases : a continuous multi-scale representation of the scene and an invariance of the decoder's latent space over spatial and scale domains. We also design a single reconstruction process that takes advantage of those inductive biases and experimentally demonstrates on-par performances in terms of quality with dedicated architecture on multiple tasks (anti-aliasing, few view reconstruction, SDF reconstruction without scene-specific initialization) while being more efficient. Moreover, RING-NeRF has the distinctive ability to dynamically increase the resolution of the model, opening the way to adaptive reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This publication has been accepted at ECCV'24</p></details> |

While gradient-based optimization in a NeRF framework updates the initial pose, this paper highlights that scale-depth ambiguity in monocular object reconstruction causes failures when the initial pose deviates moderately from the true pose. Consequently, existing methods often depend on a third-party 3D object to provide an initial object pose, leading to increased complexity and generalization issues. To address these challenges, we present SUP-NeRF, a Streamlined Unification of object Pose estimation and NeRF-based object reconstruction. SUP-NeRF decouples the object's dimension estimation and pose refinement to resolve the scale-depth ambiguity, and introduces a camera-invariant projected-box representation that generalizes cross different domains. While using a dedicated pose estimator that smoothly integrates into an object-centric NeRF, SUP-NeRF is free from external 3D detectors. SUP-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art results in both reconstruction and pose estimation tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Furthermore, SUP-NeRF exhibits exceptional cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI and Waymo datasets, surpassing prior methods with up to 50\% reduction in rotation and translation error.</p></details> |  |

Block-NeRF showed the capability of leveraging NeRF to build large city-scale models. For large-scale modeling, a mass of image data is necessary. Collecting images from specially designed data-collection vehicles can not support large-scale applications. How to acquire massive high-quality data remains an opening problem. Noting that the automotive industry has a huge amount of image data, crowd-sourcing is a convenient way for large-scale data collection. In this paper, we present a crowd-sourced framework, which utilizes substantial data captured by production vehicles to reconstruct the scene with the NeRF model. This approach solves the key problem of large-scale reconstruction, that is where the data comes from and how to use them. Firstly, the crowd-sourced massive data is filtered to remove redundancy and keep a balanced distribution in terms of time and space. Then a structure-from-motion module is performed to refine camera poses. Finally, images, as well as poses, are used to train the NeRF model in a certain block. We highlight that we present a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple modules, including data selection, sparse 3D reconstruction, sequence appearance embedding, depth supervision of ground surface, and occlusion completion. The complete system is capable of effectively processing and reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from crowd-sourced data. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted to validate the performance of our system. Moreover, we proposed an application, named first-view navigation, which leveraged the NeRF model to generate 3D street view and guide the driver with a synthesized video.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration. Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field (NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model. Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset, Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper reproduction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for visual localization within NeRF representations suffer from inefficiency and scalability issues, particularly in large-scale environments. This work proposes MatLoc-NeRF, a novel matching-based localization framework using selected NeRF features. It addresses efficiency by employing a learnable feature selection mechanism that identifies informative NeRF features for matching with query images. This eliminates the need for all NeRF features or additional descriptors, leading to faster and more accurate pose estimation. To tackle large-scale scenes, MatLoc-NeRF utilizes a pose-aware scene partitioning strategy. It ensures that only the most relevant NeRF sub-block generates key features for a specific pose. Additionally, scene segmentation and a place predictor provide fast coarse initial pose estimation. Evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that MatLoc-NeRF achieves superior efficiency and accuracy compared to existing NeRF-based localization methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Key to our approach are: (i) a dynamic hypernetwork, which learns a smooth mapping from text token embeddings to the space of NeRFs; (ii) NeRF distillation training, which distills scenes encoded in individual NeRFs into one dynamic hypernetwork. These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes -- either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024, Project page: https://threedle.github.io/hyperfields/</p></details> |

Recent NeRFs utilize feature grids to improve rendering quality and speed; however, these representations introduce significant storage overhead. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently compressing a grid-based NeRF model, addressing the storage overhead concern. Our approach is based on the non-linear transform coding paradigm, employing neural compression for compressing the model's feature grids. Due to the lack of training data involving many i.i.d scenes, we design an encoder-free, end-to-end optimized approach for individual scenes, using lightweight decoders. To leverage the spatial inhomogeneity of the latent feature grids, we introduce an importance-weighted rate-distortion objective and a sparse entropy model employing a masking mechanism. Our experimental results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing works in terms of grid-based NeRF compression efficacy and reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

Given their potential, considerable efforts have been invested to improve their performance. Nonetheless, the essential question of selecting training views is yet to be thoroughly investigated. This key aspect plays a vital role in achieving high-quality results and aligns with the well-known tenet of deep learning: "garbage in, garbage out". In this paper, we first illustrate the importance of view selection by demonstrating how a simple rotation of the test views within the most pervasive NeRF dataset can lead to consequential shifts in the performance rankings of state-of-the-art techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a unified framework for view selection methods and devise a thorough benchmark to assess its impact. Significant improvements can be achieved without leveraging error or uncertainty estimation but focusing on uniform view coverage of the reconstructed object, resulting in a training-free approach. Using this technique, we show that high-quality renderings can be achieved faster by using fewer views. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and realistic data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with random, conventional error-based, and uncertainty-guided view selection.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |
| **[Gaussian Splatting with NeRF-based Color and Opacity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13729v5)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated the remarkable potential of neural networks to capture the intricacies of 3D objects. By encoding the shape and color information within neural network weights, NeRFs excel at producing strikingly sharp novel views of 3D objects. Recently, numerous generalizations of NeRFs utilizing generative models have emerged, expanding its versatility. In contrast, Gaussian Splatting (GS) offers a similar render quality with faster training and inference as it does not need neural networks to work. It encodes information about the 3D objects in the set of Gaussian distributions that can be rendered in 3D similarly to classical meshes. Unfortunately, GS are difficult to condition since they usually require circa hundred thousand Gaussian components. To mitigate the caveats of both models, we propose a hybrid model Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) that uses GS representation of the 3D object's shape and NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of Gaussian), color and opacity, and a neural network that takes Gaussian parameters and viewing direction to produce changes in the said color and opacity. As a result, our model better describes shadows, light reflections, and the transparency of 3D objects without adding additional texture and light components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Lifting of Multiview to 3D from Unknown Pose: Wrapping NeRF inside Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06972v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We cast multiview reconstruction from unknown pose as a generative modeling problem. From a collection of unannotated 2D images of a scene, our approach simultaneously learns both a network to predict camera pose from 2D image input, as well as the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for the 3D scene. To drive learning, we wrap both the pose prediction network and NeRF inside a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and train the system via the standard denoising objective. Our framework requires the system accomplish the task of denoising an input 2D image by predicting its pose and rendering the NeRF from that pose. Learning to denoise thus forces the system to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting implicit capacity for discovering view correspondences when trained end-to-end for denoising alone. This technique allows our system to successfully build NeRFs, without pose knowledge, for challenging scenes where competing methods fail. At the conclusion of training, our learned NeRF can be extracted and used as a 3D scene model; our full system can be used to sample novel camera poses and generate novel-view images.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Can We Compress Instant-NGP-Based NeRF?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04101v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in representing 3D scenes. To expedite the rendering process, learnable explicit representations have been introduced for combination with implicit NeRF representation, which however results in a large storage space requirement. In this paper, we introduce the Context-based NeRF Compression (CNC) framework, which leverages highly efficient context models to provide a storage-friendly NeRF representation. Specifically, we excavate both level-wise and dimension-wise context dependencies to enable probability prediction for information entropy reduction. Additionally, we exploit hash collision and occupancy grids as strong prior knowledge for better context modeling. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to construct and exploit context models for NeRF compression. We achieve a size reduction of 100$\times$ and 70$\times$ with improved fidelity against the baseline Instant-NGP on Synthesic-NeRF and Tanks and Temples datasets, respectively. Additionally, we attain 86.7\% and 82.3\% storage size reduction against the SOTA NeRF compression method BiRF.

However, the scalability and accuracy of the inferred geometry are not well-documented for large-scale aerial assets,since such datasets usually result in very high memory consumption and slow convergence.. In this paper, we aim to scale the NeRF on large-scael aerial datasets and provide a thorough geometry assessment of NeRF. Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image loading for RAM, representation training for GPU memory, and increase the convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a loss of accuracy. We implement our method on a representative approach, Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS pipelines on two typical aerial datasets against LiDAR reference data. Both qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the proposed NeRF approach produces better completeness and object details than traditional approaches, although as of now, it still falls short in terms of accuracy.</p></details> | 9 Figure |

Existing methods manage controlled environments and low occlusion ratios but fall short in render quality, especially under high occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we introduce NeRF On-the-go, a simple yet effective approach that enables the robust synthesis of novel views in complex, in-the-wild scenes from only casually captured image sequences. Delving into uncertainty, our method not only efficiently eliminates distractors, even when they are predominant in captures, but also achieves a notably faster convergence speed. Through comprehensive experiments on various scenes, our method demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art techniques. This advancement opens new avenues for NeRF in diverse and dynamic real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024, first two authors contributed equally.

Standard simulator-based rendering often fails to accurately reflect real-world performance due to the sim-to-real gap, which represents the disparity between virtual simulations and real-world conditions. To mitigate this gap, we propose a workflow for building a high-fidelity simulation environment of the targeted real-world scene using NeRF. This approach is capable of rendering realistic images from novel viewpoints and constructing 3D meshes for emulating collisions. The validation of these capabilities through the comparison of success rates in both simulated and real environments demonstrates the benefits of using DriveEnv-NeRF as a real-world performance indicator. Furthermore, the DriveEnv-NeRF framework can serve as a training environment for autonomous driving agents under various lighting conditions. This approach enhances the robustness of the agents and reduces performance degradation when deployed to the target real scene, compared to agents fully trained using the standard simulator rendering pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/muyishen2040/DriveEnvNeRF</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning for Efficient NeRF Architecture Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04012v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted as practical and versatile representations for 3D scenes, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, different architectures, including the plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their combinations, entail distinct trade-offs. For instance, representations based on Hashtables enable faster rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, thereby posing challenges for spatial-relation-aware editing. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any conversion between diverse architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the rendering process. Additionally, a three-level active learning technique provides continuous feedback from teacher to student during the distillation process, achieving high-performance outcomes. Experimental evidence showcases the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmark datasets. For instance, PVD-AL can distill an MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and 0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the MLP-based model from scratch. Moreover, PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures, enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient model to meet real-time requirements like mobile devices.

| **[Dynamic NeRF: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08609v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Field(NeRF) is an novel implicit method to achieve the 3D reconstruction and representation with a high resolution. After the first research of NeRF is proposed, NeRF has gained a robust developing power and is booming in the 3D modeling, representation and reconstruction areas. However the first and most of the followed research projects based on NeRF is static, which are weak in the practical applications. Therefore, more researcher are interested and focused on the study of dynamic NeRF that is more feasible and useful in practical applications or situations. Compared with the static NeRF, implementing the Dynamic NeRF is more difficult and complex. But Dynamic is more potential in the future even is the basic of Editable NeRF. In this review, we made a detailed and abundant statement for the development and important implementation principles of Dynamci NeRF. The analysis of main principle and development of Dynamic NeRF is from 2021 to 2023, including the most of the Dynamic NeRF projects. What is more, with colorful and novel special designed figures and table, We also made a detailed comparison and analysis of different features of various of Dynamic. Besides, we analyzed and discussed the key methods to implement a Dynamic NeRF. The volume of the reference papers is large. The statements and comparisons are multidimensional. With a reading of this review, the whole development history and most of the main design method or principles of Dynamic NeRF can be easy understood and gained.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Point Resampling and Ray Transformation Aid to Editable NeRF Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07306v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In NeRF-aided editing tasks, object movement presents difficulties in supervision generation due to the introduction of variability in object positions. Moreover, the removal operations of certain scene objects often lead to empty regions, presenting challenges for NeRF models in inpainting them effectively. We propose an implicit ray transformation strategy, allowing for direct manipulation of the 3D object's pose by operating on the neural-point in NeRF rays. To address the challenge of inpainting potential empty regions, we present a plug-and-play inpainting module, dubbed differentiable neural-point resampling (DNR), which interpolates those regions in 3D space at the original ray locations within the implicit space, thereby facilitating object removal & scene inpainting tasks. Importantly, employing DNR effectively narrows the gap between ground truth and predicted implicit features, potentially increasing the mutual information (MI) of the features across rays. Then, we leverage DNR and ray transformation to construct a point-based editable NeRF pipeline PR^2T-NeRF. Results primarily evaluated on 3D object removal & inpainting tasks indicate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, our pipeline supports high-quality rendering visualization for diverse editing operations without necessitating extra supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-NeRF: Learning Residual NeRFs for Transparent Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06181v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent objects are ubiquitous in industry, pharmaceuticals, and households. Grasping and manipulating these objects is a significant challenge for robots. Existing methods have difficulty reconstructing complete depth maps for challenging transparent objects, leaving holes in the depth reconstruction. Recent work has shown neural radiance fields (NeRFs) work well for depth perception in scenes with transparent objects, and these depth maps can be used to grasp transparent objects with high accuracy. NeRF-based depth reconstruction can still struggle with especially challenging transparent objects and lighting conditions. In this work, we propose Residual-NeRF, a method to improve depth perception and training speed for transparent objects. Robots often operate in the same area, such as a kitchen. By first learning a background NeRF of the scene without transparent objects to be manipulated, we reduce the ambiguity faced by learning the changes with the new object. We propose training two additional networks: a residual NeRF learns to infer residual RGB values and densities, and a Mixnet learns how to combine background and residual NeRFs. We contribute synthetic and real experiments that suggest Residual-NeRF improves depth perception of transparent objects. The results on synthetic data suggest Residual-NeRF outperforms the baselines with a 46.1% lower RMSE and a 29.5% lower MAE. Real-world qualitative experiments suggest Residual-NeRF leads to more robust depth maps with less noise and fewer holes. Website: https://residual-nerf.github.io</p></details> |  |

To do so, we consider a simple classification task: given a particular text output, the objective is to predict the source LLM that generates the text. We evaluate this synthetic task across various groups of LLMs and find that simply fine-tuning existing text embedding models on LLM-generated texts yields excellent classification accuracy. Notably, we achieve 97.1% accuracy on held-out validation data in the five-way classification problem involving ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Our further investigation reveals that these idiosyncrasies are rooted in word-level distributions. These patterns persist even when the texts are rewritten, translated, or summarized by an external LLM, suggesting that they are also encoded in the semantic content. Additionally, we leverage LLM as judges to generate detailed, open-ended descriptions of each model's idiosyncrasies. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings, particularly for training on synthetic data and inferring model similarity.

For the first time, we uncover a common phenomenon: the understanding capabilities of MLLMs are typically stronger than their generative capabilities, with a significant gap between the two. Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over prior methods, particularly in narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation. These findings highlight the potential of HermesFlow as a general alignment framework for next-generation multimodal foundation models.

This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as important factors. In addition, we show similarities and discrepancies between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by collecting and comparing behavioral data from both.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Fast or Better? Balancing Accuracy and Cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Flexible User Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12145v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to mitigate large language model (LLM) hallucinations by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks often apply retrieval indiscriminately,leading to inefficiencies-over-retrieving when unnecessary or failing to retrieve iteratively when required for complex reasoning. Recent adaptive retrieval strategies, though adaptively navigates these retrieval strategies, predict only based on query complexity and lacks user-driven flexibility, making them infeasible for diverse user application needs. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-controllable RAG framework that enables dynamic adjustment of the accuracy-cost trade-off. Our approach leverages two classifiers: one trained to prioritize accuracy and another to prioritize retrieval efficiency. Via an interpretable control parameter $\alpha$, users can seamlessly navigate between minimal-cost retrieval and high-accuracy retrieval based on their specific requirements. We empirically demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy, retrieval cost, and user controllability, making it a practical and adaptable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Models Struggle to Learn from Strong Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12143v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks, and distilling their reasoning capabilities into smaller models has shown promise. However, we uncover an interesting phenomenon, which we term the Small Model Learnability Gap: small models ($\leq$3B parameters) do not consistently benefit from long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning or distillation from larger models. Instead, they perform better when fine-tuned on shorter, simpler reasoning chains that better align with their intrinsic learning capacity. To address this, we propose Mix Distillation, a simple yet effective strategy that balances reasoning complexity by combining long and short CoT examples or reasoning from both larger and smaller models. Our experiments demonstrate that Mix Distillation significantly improves small model reasoning performance compared to training on either data alone. These findings highlight the limitations of direct strong model distillation and underscore the importance of adapting reasoning complexity for effective reasoning capability transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoftCoT: Soft Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12134v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks by generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, most existing approaches focus on hard token decoding, which constrains reasoning within the discrete vocabulary space and may not always be optimal. While recent efforts explore continuous-space reasoning, they often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability to state-of-the-art LLMs that already perform well in zero-shot settings with a proper instruction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the underlying LLM. Specifically, we employ a lightweight assistant model to generate instance-specific soft thought tokens speculatively as the initial chain of thoughts, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a projection module. Experimental results on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances LLM reasoning performance through supervised, parameter-efficient fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains.

| **[Transformer Dynamics: A neuroscientific approach to interpretability of large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12131v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence models have exploded in scale and capability, understanding of their internal mechanisms remains a critical challenge. Inspired by the success of dynamical systems approaches in neuroscience, here we propose a novel framework for studying computations in deep learning systems. We focus on the residual stream (RS) in transformer models, conceptualizing it as a dynamical system evolving across layers. We find that activations of individual RS units exhibit strong continuity across layers, despite the RS being a non-privileged basis. Activations in the RS accelerate and grow denser over layers, while individual units trace unstable periodic orbits. In reduced-dimensional spaces, the RS follows a curved trajectory with attractor-like dynamics in the lower layers. These insights bridge dynamical systems theory and mechanistic interpretability, establishing a foundation for a "neuroscience of AI" that combines theoretical rigor with large-scale data analysis to advance our understanding of modern neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Autonomous Agents via Automatic Reward Modeling And Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12130v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories. The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities. By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments. This research paves the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of tackling a wide range of real-world problems requiring multi-step decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025, Project page: https://armap-agent.github.io</p></details> |

The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency due to LLMs' disfavor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimal Ranks, Maximum Confidence: Parameter-efficient Uncertainty Quantification for LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12122v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices, significantly reducing storage and computational overhead. While effective, standard LoRA lacks mechanisms for uncertainty quantification, leading to overconfident and poorly calibrated models. Bayesian variants of LoRA address this limitation, but at the cost of a significantly increased number of trainable parameters, partially offsetting the original efficiency gains. Additionally, these models are harder to train and may suffer from unstable convergence. In this work, we propose a novel parameter-efficient Bayesian LoRA, demonstrating that effective uncertainty quantification can be achieved in very low-dimensional parameter spaces. The proposed method achieves strong performance with improved calibration and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical findings show that, with the appropriate projection of the weight space: (1) uncertainty can be effectively modeled in a low-dimensional space, and (2) weight covariances exhibit low ranks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs on the Line: Data Determines Loss-to-Loss Scaling Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12120v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws guide the development of large language models (LLMs) by offering estimates for the optimal balance of model size, tokens, and compute. More recently, loss-to-loss scaling laws that relate losses across pretraining datasets and downstream tasks have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and improving LLM performance. In this work, we investigate which factors most strongly influence loss-to-loss scaling. Our experiments reveal that the pretraining data and tokenizer determine the scaling trend. In contrast, model size, optimization hyperparameters, and even significant architectural differences, such as between transformer-based models like Llama and state-space models like Mamba, have limited impact. Consequently, practitioners should carefully curate suitable pretraining datasets for optimal downstream performance, while architectures and other settings can be freely optimized for training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Self-Pruning Intrinsic Selection Method for Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12119v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual instruction tuning refines pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance their real-world task performance. However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces significant data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. Existing data selection methods predominantly rely on proxy models or loss-based metrics, both of which impose substantial computational overheads due to the necessity of model inference and backpropagation. To address this challenge, we propose PRISM, a novel training-free approach for efficient multimodal data selection. Unlike existing methods, PRISM eliminates the reliance on proxy models, warm-up pretraining, and gradient-based optimization. Instead, it leverages Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the intrinsic visual encoding properties of MLLMs, computing a task-specific correlation score to identify high-value instances. This not only enbles data-efficient selection,but maintains the original performance. Empirical evaluations across multiple MLLMs demonstrate that PRISM reduces the overall time required for visual instruction tuning and data selection to just 30% of conventional methods, while surpassing fully fine-tuned models across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, achieving a 101.7% relative improvement in final performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09782v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We will reflect comments from the reviewers and re-submit</p></details> |
| **[CELL your Model: Contrastive Explanations for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11785v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions. However, in the case of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain. Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a contrastive explanation method requiring simply black-box/query access. Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a scoring function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a specific real valued quantity (viz. class label). To this end, we offer a novel budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts based on such a scoring function while adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts. We show the efficacy of our method on important natural language tasks such as open-text generation and chatbot conversations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM) agents can effectively use external tools for complex real-world tasks, they require memory systems to leverage historical experiences. Current memory systems enable basic storage and retrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts to incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and structures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents that can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic principles of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create interconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a new memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple structured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags. The system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections, establishing links where meaningful similarities exist. Additionally, this process enables memory evolution - as new memories are integrated, they can trigger updates to the contextual representations and attributes of existing historical memories, allowing the memory network to continuously refine its understanding. Our approach combines the structured organization principles of Zettelkasten with the flexibility of agent-driven decision making, allowing for more adaptive and context-aware memory management. Empirical experiments on six foundation models show superior improvement against existing SOTA baselines.

| **[Personality Structured Interview for Large Language Model Simulation in Personality Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12109v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although psychometrics researchers have recently explored the use of large language models (LLMs) as proxies for human participants, LLMs often fail to generate heterogeneous data with human-like diversity, which diminishes their value in advancing social science research. To address these challenges, we explored the potential of the theory-informed Personality Structured Interview (PSI) as a tool for simulating human responses in personality research. In this approach, the simulation is grounded in nuanced real-human interview transcripts that target the personality construct of interest. We have provided a growing set of 357 structured interview transcripts from a representative sample, each containing an individual's response to 32 open-ended questions carefully designed to gather theory-based personality evidence. Additionally, grounded in psychometric research, we have summarized an evaluation framework to systematically validate LLM-generated psychometric data. Results from three experiments demonstrate that well-designed structured interviews could improve human-like heterogeneity in LLM-simulated personality data and predict personality-related behavioral outcomes (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors and counterproductive work behavior). We further discuss the role of theory-informed structured interviews in LLM-based simulation and outline a general framework for designing structured interviews to simulate human-like data for psychometric research.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 Pa...</summary><p>41 Pages, 30 Tables, 5 Figures</p></details> |

A Systematic Analysis of Multimodal LLM Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03823v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progression of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated superior performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, the issue of data contamination during training creates challenges in performance evaluation and comparison. While numerous methods exist for detecting models' contamination in large language models (LLMs), they are less effective for MLLMs due to their various modalities and multiple training phases. In this study, we introduce a multimodal data contamination detection framework, MM-Detect, designed for MLLMs. Our experimental results indicate that MM-Detect is quite effective and sensitive in identifying varying degrees of contamination, and can highlight significant performance improvements due to the leakage of multimodal benchmark training sets. Furthermore, we explore whether the contamination originates from the base LLMs used by MLLMs or the multimodal training phase, providing new insights into the stages at which contamination may be introduced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Available: https://github.com/MLLM-Data-Contamination/MM-Detect</p></details> |
| **[Relational Norms for Human-AI Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12102v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How we should design and interact with social artificial intelligence depends on the socio-relational role the AI is meant to emulate or occupy. In human society, relationships such as teacher-student, parent-child, neighbors, siblings, or employer-employee are governed by specific norms that prescribe or proscribe cooperative functions including hierarchy, care, transaction, and mating. These norms shape our judgments of what is appropriate for each partner. For example, workplace norms may allow a boss to give orders to an employee, but not vice versa, reflecting hierarchical and transactional expectations. As AI agents and chatbots powered by large language models are increasingly designed to serve roles analogous to human positions - such as assistant, mental health provider, tutor, or romantic partner - it is imperative to examine whether and how human relational norms should extend to human-AI interactions. Our analysis explores how differences between AI systems and humans, such as the absence of conscious experience and immunity to fatigue, may affect an AI's capacity to fulfill relationship-specific functions and adhere to corresponding norms. This analysis, which is a collaborative effort by philosophers, psychologists, relationship scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and AI researchers, carries important implications for AI systems design, user behavior, and regulation. While we accept that AI systems can offer significant benefits such as increased availability and consistency in certain socio-relational roles, they also risk fostering unhealthy dependencies or unrealistic expectations that could spill over into human-human relationships. We propose that understanding and thoughtfully shaping (or implementing) suitable human-AI relational norms will be crucial for ensuring that human-AI interactions are ethical, trustworthy, and favorable to human well-being.</p></details> | 76 pages, 2 figures |

TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. We demonstrate the corresponding TokCom benefits in a GenSC setup for image, leveraging cross-modal context information, which increases the bandwidth efficiency by 70.8% with negligible loss of semantic/perceptual quality. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

However, their substantial computational requirements present challenges for practical deployment. Model quantization has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce memory usage and computational costs by employing lower precision and bit-width representations. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of quantization on mathematical reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that aggressive quantization methods like AWQ and GPTQ introduce up to 32.39% accuracy degradation (average 11.31%) on Llama-3 models, particularly in numerical computation and reasoning planning. To address this, we introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework combining qualitative capability analysis and quantitative error assessment. We further develop targeted recovery strategies, showing that fine-tuning quantized models on only 545 task-specific examples for 3 minutes on 4 GPUs effectively restores reasoning capabilities to near full-precision levels. Additionally, our error assessment pipeline achieves 98.9% accuracy in diagnosing and localizing errors across 3,366 failure cases, providing actionable insights for mitigating quantization-induced degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Statistical Learning: Supervised Learning of Statistical Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12088v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work demonstrates that the tools and principles driving the success of large language models (LLMs) can be repurposed to tackle distribution-level tasks, where the goal is to predict properties of the data-generating distribution rather than labels for individual datapoints. These tasks encompass statistical inference problems such as parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, or mutual information estimation. Framing these tasks within traditional machine learning pipelines is challenging, as supervision is typically tied to individual datapoint. We propose meta-statistical learning, a framework inspired by multi-instance learning that reformulates statistical inference tasks as supervised learning problems. In this approach, entire datasets are treated as single inputs to neural networks, which predict distribution-level parameters. Transformer-based architectures, without positional encoding, provide a natural fit due to their permutation-invariance properties. By training on large-scale synthetic datasets, meta-statistical models can leverage the scalability and optimization infrastructure of Transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate the framework's versatility with applications in hypothesis testing and mutual information estimation, showing strong performance, particularly for small datasets where traditional neural methods struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[APB: Accelerating Distributed Long-Context Inference by Passing Compressed Context Blocks across GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12085v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While long-context inference is crucial for advancing large language model (LLM) applications, its prefill speed remains a significant bottleneck. Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations. APB achieves speedups of up to 9.2x, 4.2x, and 1.6x compared with FlashAttn, RingAttn, and StarAttn, respectively, without any observable task performance degradation. We provide the implementation and experiment code of APB in https://github.com/thunlp/APB.</p></details> | Preprint |

While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria, improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Experimental Results sections</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Simulate Social Media Engagement? A Study on Action-Guided Response Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12073v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media enables dynamic user engagement with trending topics, and recent research has explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) for response generation. While some studies investigate LLMs as agents for simulating user behavior on social media, their focus remains on practical viability and scalability rather than a deeper understanding of how well LLM aligns with human behavior. This paper analyzes LLMs' ability to simulate social media engagement through action guided response generation, where a model first predicts a user's most likely engagement action-retweet, quote, or rewrite-towards a trending post before generating a personalized response conditioned on the predicted action. We benchmark GPT-4o-mini, O1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 in social media engagement simulation regarding a major societal event discussed on X. Our findings reveal that zero-shot LLMs underperform BERT in action prediction, while few-shot prompting initially degrades the prediction accuracy of LLMs with limited examples. However, in response generation, few-shot LLMs achieve stronger semantic alignment with ground truth posts.</p></details> |  |
| **[TokenSkip: Controllable Chain-of-Thought Compression in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12067v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop.</p></details> |  |

In commercial construction, the complexity of automated scheduling often requires manual intervention to ensure precision. We propose CONSTRUCTA, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to optimize construction schedules in complex projects like semiconductor fabrication. CONSTRUCTA addresses key challenges by: (1) integrating construction-specific knowledge through static RAG; (2) employing context-sampling techniques inspired by architectural expertise to provide relevant input; and (3) deploying Construction DPO to align schedules with expert preferences using RLHF. Experiments on proprietary data demonstrate performance improvements of +42.3% in missing value prediction, +79.1% in dependency analysis, and +28.9% in automated planning compared to baseline methods, showcasing its potential to revolutionize construction workflows and inspire domain-specific LLM advancements.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-generated Text Detection with a GLTR-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12064v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of LLMs (Large Language Models) has contributed to the improved performance and development of cutting-edge NLP applications. However, these can also pose risks when used maliciously, such as spreading fake news, harmful content, impersonating individuals, or facilitating school plagiarism, among others. This is because LLMs can generate high-quality texts, which are challenging to differentiate from those written by humans. GLTR, which stands for Giant Language Model Test Room and was developed jointly by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and HarvardNLP, is a visual tool designed to help detect machine-generated texts based on GPT-2, that highlights the words in text depending on the probability that they were machine-generated. One limitation of GLTR is that the results it returns can sometimes be ambiguous and lead to confusion. This study aims to explore various ways to improve GLTR's effectiveness for detecting AI-generated texts within the context of the IberLef-AuTexTification 2023 shared task, in both English and Spanish languages. Experiment results show that our GLTR-based GPT-2 model overcomes the state-of-the-art models on the English dataset with a macro F1-score of 80.19%, except for the first ranking model (80.91%). However, for the Spanish dataset, we obtained a macro F1-score of 66.20%, which differs by 4.57% compared to the top-performing model.</p></details> |  |

This work explores a novel approach to guiding LLM behaviour through role vectors, an alternative to persona-based prompting. We construct 29 role vectors derived from model activations and evaluate their impact on benchmark performance across multiple domains. Our analysis investigates whether these vectors can effectively steer models toward domain-specific expertise. We measure two key interventions: (i) activation addition, which reinforces role-specific directions, and (ii) directional ablation, which removes them. Results on well-established benchmarks indicate that role vectors do, in fact, influence model behaviour, improving task performance in relevant domains while marginally affecting unrelated tasks. This, in turn, suggests that manipulating internal model representations has a greater impact on outcomes than persona-based prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR 2025 February cycle</p></details> |

However, current evaluations overlook physics-based reasoning - a complex task requiring physics theorems and constraints. We present PhysReason, a 1,200-problem benchmark comprising knowledge-based (25%) and reasoning-based (75%) problems, where the latter are divided into three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). Notably, problems require an average of 8.1 solution steps, with hard requiring 15.6, reflecting the complexity of physics-based reasoning. We propose the Physics Solution Auto Scoring Framework, incorporating efficient answer-level and comprehensive step-level evaluations. Top-performing models like Deepseek-R1, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, and o3-mini-high achieve less than 60% on answer-level evaluation, with performance dropping from knowledge questions (75.11%) to hard problems (31.95%). Through step-level evaluation, we identified four key bottlenecks: Physics Theorem Application, Physics Process Understanding, Calculation, and Physics Condition Analysis. These findings position PhysReason as a novel and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating physics-based reasoning capabilities in large language models. Our code and data will be published at https:/dxzxy12138.github.io/PhysReason.</p></details> |  |

BCIs, particularly those leveraging Electroencephalography (EEG), provide a non-invasive means of translating neural activity into meaningful outputs. Recent advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly improved EEG-based generation of images, text, and speech. This paper provides a literature review of the state-of-the-art in EEG-based multimodal generation, focusing on (i) EEG-to-image generation through GANs, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models, and (ii) EEG-to-text generation leveraging Transformer based language models and contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we discuss the emerging domain of EEG-to-speech synthesis, an evolving multimodal frontier. We highlight key datasets, use cases, challenges, and EEG feature encoding methods that underpin generative approaches. By providing a structured overview of EEG-based generative AI, this survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with insights to advance neural decoding, enhance assistive technologies, and expand the frontiers of brain-computer interaction.</p></details> |  |

Introducing external knowledge, such as knowledge graph, can enhance the LLMs' ability to provide factual answers. LLMs have the ability to interactively explore knowledge graphs. However, most approaches have been affected by insufficient internal knowledge excavation in LLMs, limited generation of trustworthy knowledge reasoning paths, and a vague integration between internal and external knowledge. Therefore, we propose KnowPath, a knowledge-enhanced large model framework driven by the collaboration of internal and external knowledge. It relies on the internal knowledge of the LLM to guide the exploration of interpretable directed subgraphs in external knowledge graphs, better integrating the two knowledge sources for more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets confirm the superiority of KnowPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeChain: Safety of Language Models with Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12025v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 models, leverage long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate structured intermediate steps, enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, long CoT does not inherently guarantee safe outputs, potentially leading to harmful consequences such as the introduction of security vulnerabilities in code or the spread of misinformation. Current research on large language model (LLM) safety usually focuses on short-answer responses, overlooking the long CoT style outputs of LRMs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of LRM safety. First, we investigate safety evaluators calibrated against human annotations. Using our newly developed metrics, we thoroughly assess the safety of 12 state-of-the-art LRMs on StrongReject and WildJailbreak datasets. Our results show that LRMs are not safe compared to their reasoning advance. Further, we perform a fine-grained analysis of the reasoning trace and final answer. We find that three decoding strategies-ZeroThink, LessThink, and MoreThink-can improve model safety without additional training. However, these strategies either use constrained reasoning traces or incur high inference costs. To better strengthen LRM safety, we introduce SafeChain, the first-of-its-kind safety training dataset in CoT style. We fine-tune two LRMs with SafeChain, showing that it not only enhances model safety but also preserves performance across 6 reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude: Adaptive Reasoning for Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12022v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable. These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state. This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%. The code will be available at https://github.com/qixucen/atom.</p></details> |  |

However, the effective merging of expert models remains an open challenge, especially for models with highly divergent weight parameters or different architectures. State-of-the-art MoE merging methods only work with homogeneous model architectures and rely on simple unweighted averaging to merge expert layers, which does not address parameter interference and requires extensive fine-tuning of the merged MoE to restore performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces new MoE merging techniques, including strategies to mitigate parameter interference, routing heuristics to reduce the need for MoE fine-tuning, and a novel method for merging experts with different architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, reducing fine-tuning costs, improving performance over state-of-the-art methods, and expanding the applicability of MoE merging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

Pairwise ranking has emerged as a new method for evaluating human preferences for LLMs. This approach entails humans evaluating pairs of model outputs based on a predefined criterion. By collecting these comparisons, a ranking can be constructed using methods such as Elo. However, applying these algorithms as constructed in the context of LLM evaluation introduces several challenges. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of ranking systems for head-to-head comparisons of LLMs. We formally define a set of fundamental principles for effective ranking and conduct a series of extensive evaluations on the robustness of several ranking algorithms in the context of LLMs. Our analysis uncovers key insights into the factors that affect ranking accuracy and efficiency, offering guidelines for selecting the most appropriate methods based on specific evaluation contexts and resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

In order to effectively adopt and leverage UMR for downstream tasks, efforts must be placed toward developing a UMR technological ecosystem. Though still limited amounts of UMR annotations have been produced to date, in this work, we investigate the first approaches to producing text from multilingual UMR graphs: (1) a pipeline conversion of UMR to AMR, then using AMR-to-text generation models, (2) fine-tuning large language models with UMR data, and (3) fine-tuning existing AMR-to-text generation models with UMR data. Our best performing model achieves a multilingual BERTscore of 0.825 for English and 0.882 for Chinese when compared to the reference, which is a promising indication of the effectiveness of fine-tuning approaches for UMR-to-text generation with even limited amounts of UMR data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Helpfulness-Truthfulness Trade-Off with Uncertainty-Aware Instruction Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11962v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) can enhance the helpfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it may lower their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses with long-tail knowledge that is not well covered during pre-training, leading to more informative but less truthful answers when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate this helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off in IFT and propose $\textbf{UNIT}$, a novel IFT paradigm to address it. UNIT teaches LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly reflect it at the end of their responses. Experimental results show that UNIT-tuned models maintain their helpfulness while distinguishing between certain and uncertain claims, thereby reducing hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18547v4)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

| **[On Representational Dissociation of Language and Arithmetic in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11932v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The association between language and (non-linguistic) thinking ability in humans has long been debated, and recently, neuroscientific evidence of brain activity patterns has been considered. Such a scientific context naturally raises an interdisciplinary question -- what about such a language-thought dissociation in large language models (LLMs)? In this paper, as an initial foray, we explore this question by focusing on simple arithmetic skills (e.g., $1+2=$ ?) as a thinking ability and analyzing the geometry of their encoding in LLMs' representation space. Our experiments with linear classifiers and cluster separability tests demonstrate that simple arithmetic equations and general language input are encoded in completely separated regions in LLMs' internal representation space across all the layers, which is also supported with more controlled stimuli (e.g., spelled-out equations). These tentatively suggest that arithmetic reasoning is mapped into a distinct region from general language input, which is in line with the neuroscientific observations of human brain activations, while we also point out their somewhat cognitively implausible geometric properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAPHGPT-O: Synergistic Multimodal Comprehension and Generation on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11925v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled the integration of multiple modalities, including texts and images, within the large language model (LLM) framework. However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Text to Trust: Empowering AI-assisted Decision Making with Adaptive LLM-powered Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11919v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted decision making becomes increasingly prevalent, yet individuals often fail to utilize AI-based decision aids appropriately especially when the AI explanations are absent, potentially as they do not %understand reflect on AI's decision recommendations critically. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional conversational and analytical capabilities, present great opportunities to enhance AI-assisted decision making in the absence of AI explanations by providing natural-language-based analysis of AI's decision recommendation, e.g., how each feature of a decision making task might contribute to the AI recommendation. In this paper, via a randomized experiment, we first show that presenting LLM-powered analysis of each task feature, either sequentially or concurrently, does not significantly improve people's AI-assisted decision performance. To enable decision makers to better leverage LLM-powered analysis, we then propose an algorithmic framework to characterize the effects of LLM-powered analysis on human decisions and dynamically decide which analysis to present. Our evaluation with human subjects shows that this approach effectively improves decision makers' appropriate reliance on AI in AI-assisted decision making.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |
| **[Boosting Private Domain Understanding of Efficient MLLMs: A Tuning-free, Adaptive, Universal Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19684v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient multimodal large language models (EMLLMs), in contrast to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reduce model size and computational costs and are often deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, due to data privacy concerns, existing open-source EMLLMs rarely have access to private domain-specific data during the pre-training process, making them difficult to directly apply in device-specific domains, such as certain business scenarios. To address this weakness, this paper focuses on the efficient adaptation of EMLLMs to private domains, specifically in two areas: 1) how to reduce data requirements, and 2) how to avoid parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, we propose a tun\textbf{\underline{I}}ng-free, a\textbf{\underline{D}}aptiv\textbf{\underline{E}}, univers\textbf{\underline{AL}} \textbf{\underline{Prompt}} Optimization Framework, abbreviated as \textit{\textbf{\ourmethod{}}} which consists of two stages: 1) Predefined Prompt, based on the reinforcement searching strategy, generate a prompt optimization strategy tree to acquire optimization priors; 2) Prompt Reflection initializes the prompt based on optimization priors, followed by self-reflection to further search and refine the prompt. By doing so, \ourmethod{} elegantly generates the ``ideal prompts'' for processing private domain-specific data. Note that our method requires no parameter fine-tuning and only a small amount of data to quickly adapt to the data distribution of private data. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that our proposed \ourmethod{} significantly improves both efficiency and performance compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AES systems face three major challenges: (1) reliance on handcrafted features that limit generalizability, (2) difficulty in capturing fine-grained traits like coherence and argumentation, and (3) inability to handle multimodal contexts. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we propose EssayJudge, the first multimodal benchmark to evaluate AES capabilities across lexical-, sentence-, and discourse-level traits. By leveraging MLLMs' strengths in trait-specific scoring and multimodal context understanding, EssayJudge aims to offer precise, context-rich evaluations without manual feature engineering, addressing longstanding AES limitations. Our experiments with 18 representative MLLMs reveal gaps in AES performance compared to human evaluation, particularly in discourse-level traits, highlighting the need for further advancements in MLLM-based AES research.

We address this challenge by proposing ORI (O Routing Intelligence), a dynamic framework that leverages a set of LLMs. By intelligently routing incoming queries to the most suitable model, ORI not only improves task-specific accuracy, but also maintains efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent accuracy gains while controlling computational overhead. By intelligently routing queries, ORI outperforms the strongest individual models by up to 2.7 points on MMLU and 1.8 points on MuSR, ties the top performance on ARC, and on BBH. These results underscore the benefits of a multi-model strategy and demonstrate how ORI's adaptive architecture can more effectively handle diverse tasks, offering a scalable, high-performance solution for a system of multiple large language models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Bridging Compressed Image Latents and Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19651v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first-ever study of adapting compressed image latents to suit the needs of downstream vision tasks that adopt Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs have extended the success of large language models to modalities (e.g. images) beyond text, but their billion scale hinders deployment on resource-constrained end devices. While cloud-hosted MLLMs could be available, transmitting raw, uncompressed images captured by end devices to the cloud requires an efficient image compression system. To address this, we focus on emerging neural image compression and propose a novel framework with a lightweight transform-neck and a surrogate loss to adapt compressed image latents for MLLM-based vision tasks. Given the huge scale of MLLMs, our framework excludes the entire downstream MLLM except part of its visual encoder from training our system. This stands out from most existing coding for machine approaches that involve downstream networks in training and thus could be impractical when the networks are MLLMs. The proposed framework is general in that it is applicable to various MLLMs, neural image codecs, and multiple application scenarios, where the neural image codec can be (1) pre-trained for human perception without updating, (2) fully updated for joint human and machine perception, or (3) fully updated for only machine perception. Extensive experiments on different neural image codecs and various MLLMs show that our method achieves great rate-accuracy performance with much less complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field. In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMRC: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Understanding Multimodal Large Language Model in Real-World Conversation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11903v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in open-ended conversation, generating more accurate and personalized responses. However, their abilities to memorize, recall, and reason in sustained interactions within real-world scenarios remain underexplored. This paper introduces MMRC, a Multi-Modal Real-world Conversation benchmark for evaluating six core open-ended abilities of MLLMs: information extraction, multi-turn reasoning, information update, image management, memory recall, and answer refusal. With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions. We identify four common failure patterns: long-term memory degradation, inadequacies in updating factual knowledge, accumulated assumption of error propagation, and reluctance to say no. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple yet effective NOTE-TAKING strategy, which can record key information from the conversation and remind the model during its responses, enhancing conversational capabilities. Experiments across six MLLMs demonstrate significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMEL: Continuous Action Masking Enabled by Large Language Models for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11896v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous action spaces encounters persistent challenges, such as inefficient exploration and convergence to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, we propose CAMEL, a novel framework integrating LLM-generated suboptimal policies into the RL training pipeline. CAMEL leverages dynamic action masking and an adaptive epsilon-masking mechanism to guide exploration during early training stages while gradually enabling agents to optimize policies independently. At the core of CAMEL lies the integration of Python-executable suboptimal policies generated by LLMs based on environment descriptions and task objectives. Although simplistic and hard-coded, these policies offer valuable initial guidance for RL agents. To effectively utilize these priors, CAMEL employs masking-aware optimization to dynamically constrain the action space based on LLM outputs. Additionally, epsilon-masking gradually reduces reliance on LLM-generated guidance, enabling agents to transition from constrained exploration to autonomous policy refinement. Experimental validation on Gymnasium MuJoCo environments demonstrates the effectiveness of CAMEL. In Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, LLM-generated policies significantly improve sample efficiency, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing expert masking baselines. For Walker2d-v4, where LLMs struggle to accurately model bipedal gait dynamics, CAMEL maintains robust RL performance without notable degradation, highlighting the framework's adaptability across diverse tasks. While CAMEL shows promise in enhancing sample efficiency and mitigating convergence challenges, these issues remain open for further research. Future work aims to generalize CAMEL to multimodal LLMs for broader observation-action spaces and automate policy evaluation, reducing human intervention and enhancing scalability in RL training pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |

Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model parameters, offers a promising solution for improving LLM efficiency and sustainability. While post-training quantization methods typically achieve 4-8 bits per parameter, recent research suggests that training LLMs with 1.58 bits per weight parameter from scratch can maintain model accuracy while greatly reducing memory requirements and energy consumption at inference time. Here, we investigate a training strategy for quantization-aware pre-training, where the models are first trained with 16-bit precision and then transition into 1.58-bit quantization-aware training. Our results on 11 downstream tasks show that this 16-to-1.58-bit training strategy is preferable over full 1.58-bit training and leaves models closer to those which have undergone 16-bit training. We further investigate the effects of retaining the optimizer state at the transition point and gradually phasing in quantization strength -- finding that both techniques alleviate the magnitude of loss spikes, but also that these effects can be compensated through further training.</p></details> |  |

Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o1 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system optimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs, Bitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate sub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features two core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S), which ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our experiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new benchmarks in the field. Additionally, we expand TL to element-wise lookup table (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs in the appendix, presenting both theoretical and empirical evidence of its considerable potential. Bitnet.cpp is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/tree/paper , offering a sophisticated solution for the efficient and practical deployment of edge LLMs.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Prompt Stability Scoring for Text Annotation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02039v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers are increasingly using language models (LMs) for text annotation. These approaches rely only on a prompt telling the model to return a given output according to a set of instructions. The reproducibility of LM outputs may nonetheless be vulnerable to small changes in the prompt design. This calls into question the replicability of classification routines. To tackle this problem, researchers have typically tested a variety of semantically similar prompts to determine what we call ``prompt stability." These approaches remain ad-hoc and task specific. In this article, we propose a general framework for diagnosing prompt stability by adapting traditional approaches to intra- and inter-coder reliability scoring. We call the resulting metric the Prompt Stability Score (PSS) and provide a Python package \texttt{promptstability} for its estimation. Using six different datasets and twelve outcomes, we classify $\sim$3.1m rows of data and $\sim$300m input tokens to: a) diagnose when prompt stability is low; and b) demonstrate the functionality of the package. We conclude by providing best practice recommendations for applied researchers.</p></details> | 39 pages, 5 figures |

However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing \emph{argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs)}, a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs' performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

JoLT uses the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to define joint distributions over tabular data conditioned on user-specified side information about the problem, exploiting the vast repository of latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs. JoLT defines joint distributions for multiple target variables with potentially heterogeneous data types without any data conversion, data preprocessing, special handling of missing data, or model training, making it accessible and efficient for practitioners. Our experiments show that JoLT outperforms competitive methods on low-shot single-target and multi-target tabular classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we show that JoLT can automatically handle missing data and perform data imputation by leveraging textual side information. We argue that due to its simplicity and generality, JoLT is an effective approach for a wide variety of real prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

The combination of Federated Learning (FL) and LLMs (federated LLMs) offers a solution by leveraging distributed data while protecting privacy, which positions it as an ideal choice for sensitive domains. However, Federated LLMs still suffer from robustness challenges, including data heterogeneity, malicious clients, and adversarial attacks, which greatly hinder their applications. We first introduce the robustness problems in federated LLMs, to address these challenges, we propose FedEAT (Federated Embedding space Adversarial Training), a novel framework that applies adversarial training in the embedding space of client LLM and employs a robust aggregation approach, specifically geometric median aggregation, to enhance the robustness of Federated LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that FedEAT effectively improves the robustness of Federated LLMs with minimal performance loss.</p></details> |  |

Such resources are usually selectively integrated into the prompt so that LLMs can directly perform translation without any specific training, via their in-context learning capability (ICL). However, the relative importance of each type of resource e.g., dictionary, grammar book, and retrieved parallel examples, is not entirely clear. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates how each resource and its quality affects the translation performance, with the Manchu language as our case study. To remove any prior knowledge of Manchu encoded in the LLM parameters and single out the effect of ICL, we also experiment with an encrypted version of Manchu texts. Our results indicate that high-quality dictionaries and good parallel examples are very helpful, while grammars hardly help. In a follow-up study, we showcase a promising application of in-context MT: parallel data augmentation as a way to bootstrap the conventional MT model. When monolingual data abound, generating synthetic parallel data through in-context MT offers a pathway to mitigate data scarcity and build effective and efficient low-resource neural MT systems.</p></details> | preprint |

A systematic search of studies from 2021 to 2024 identified 61 articles. Four types of corpora were used: clinical resources, literature, open-source datasets, and web-crawled data. Common construction techniques included pre-training, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation, with 44 studies combining multiple methods. Evaluation metrics were categorized into process, usability, and outcome metrics, with outcome metrics divided into model-based and expert-assessed outcomes. The study identified critical gaps in corpus fairness, which contributed to biases from geographic, cultural, and socio-economic factors. The reliance on unverified or unstructured data highlighted the need for better integration of evidence-based clinical guidelines. Future research should focus on developing a tiered corpus architecture with vetted sources and dynamic weighting, while ensuring model transparency. Additionally, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for domain-specific models called for comprehensive validation of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing \textit{content transformations}, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals. To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it, showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research efforts in this direction.

Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLM Agents Maintain a Persona in Discourse?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11843v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as conversational agents, exploiting their capabilities in various sectors such as education, law, medicine, and more. However, LLMs are often subjected to context-shifting behaviour, resulting in a lack of consistent and interpretable personality-aligned interactions. Adherence to psychological traits lacks comprehensive analysis, especially in the case of dyadic (pairwise) conversations. We examine this challenge from two viewpoints, initially using two conversation agents to generate a discourse on a certain topic with an assigned personality from the OCEAN framework (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) as High/Low for each trait. This is followed by using multiple judge agents to infer the original traits assigned to explore prediction consistency, inter-model agreement, and alignment with the assigned personality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can be guided toward personality-driven dialogue, their ability to maintain personality traits varies significantly depending on the combination of models and discourse settings. These inconsistencies emphasise the challenges in achieving stable and interpretable personality-aligned interactions in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Generalization on Text Attribute Graphs: Principles with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11836v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently been introduced to graph learning, aiming to extend their zero-shot generalization success to tasks where labeled graph data is scarce. Among these applications, inference over text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents unique challenges: existing methods struggle with LLMs' limited context length for processing large node neighborhoods and the misalignment between node embeddings and the LLM token space. To address these issues, we establish two key principles for ensuring generalization and derive the framework LLM-BP accordingly: (1) Unifying the attribute space with task-adaptive embeddings, where we leverage LLM-based encoders and task-aware prompting to enhance generalization of the text attribute embeddings; (2) Developing a generalizable graph information aggregation mechanism, for which we adopt belief propagation with LLM-estimated parameters that adapt across graphs. Evaluations on 11 real-world TAG benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-BP significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 8.10% improvement with task-conditional embeddings and an additional 1.71% gain from adaptive aggregation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Knowledge Injection into Large Language Models via Diverse Augmentation for Domain-Specific RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08356v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent method for incorporating domain knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). While RAG enhances response relevance by incorporating retrieved domain knowledge in the context, retrieval errors can still lead to hallucinations and incorrect answers. To recover from retriever failures, domain knowledge is injected by fine-tuning the model to generate the correct response, even in the case of retrieval errors. However, we observe that without systematic knowledge augmentation, fine-tuned LLMs may memorize new information but still fail to extract relevant domain knowledge, leading to poor performance. In this work, we present a novel framework that significantly enhances the fine-tuning process by augmenting the training data in two ways -- context augmentation and knowledge paraphrasing. In context augmentation, we create multiple training samples for a given QA pair by varying the relevance of the retrieved information, teaching the model when to ignore and when to rely on retrieved content. In knowledge paraphrasing, we fine-tune with multiple answers to the same question, enabling LLMs to better internalize specialized knowledge. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to fine-tuning, we add a domain-specific identifier to a question and also utilize a replay buffer containing general QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method over existing techniques, achieving up to 10\% relative gain in token-level recall while preserving the LLM's generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 14 tables, to be published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Central to the success of these models is the integration of sophisticated architectural components aimed at improving training stability, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Among these components, normalization operation, such as layer normalization (LayerNorm), emerges as a pivotal technique, offering substantial benefits to the overall model performance. However, previous studies have indicated that normalization operations can substantially elevate processing latency and energy usage. In this work, we adopt the principles of algorithm and hardware co-design, introducing a holistic normalization accelerating method named HAAN. The evaluation results demonstrate that HAAN can achieve significantly better hardware performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in a learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge -- a set of innate systems to help understand the world -- needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages,14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigated the role of such language models in text classification and how they compare with other approaches relying on smaller pre-trained language models. Considering 32 datasets spanning 8 languages, we compared zero-shot classification, few-shot fine-tuning and synthetic data based classifiers with classifiers built using the complete human labeled dataset. Our results show that zero-shot approaches do well for sentiment classification, but are outperformed by other approaches for the rest of the tasks, and synthetic data sourced from multiple LLMs can build better classifiers than zero-shot open LLMs. We also see wide performance disparities across languages in all the classification scenarios. We expect that these findings would guide practitioners working on developing text classification systems across languages.</p></details> | Pre-print |

It challenges MLLMs to generate a correct program that fulfills specific functionality requirements based on a given flowchart, which visually represents the desired algorithm or process. Code-Vision comprises three subsets: HumanEval-V, Algorithm, and MATH, which evaluate MLLMs' coding abilities across basic programming, algorithmic, and mathematical problem-solving domains. Our experiments evaluate 12 MLLMs on Code-Vision. Experimental results demonstrate that there is a large performance difference between proprietary and open-source models. On Hard problems, GPT-4o can achieve 79.3% pass@1, but the best open-source model only achieves 15%. Further experiments reveal that Code-Vision can pose unique challenges compared to other multimodal reasoning benchmarks MMCode and MathVista. We also explore the reason for the poor performance of the open-source models. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/wanghanbinpanda/CodeVision.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, existing ABSA datasets are predominantly English-centric, limiting the scope for multilingual evaluation and research. To bridge this gap, we present M-ABSA, a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains and 21 languages, making it the most extensive multilingual parallel dataset for ABSA to date. Our primary focus is on triplet extraction, which involves identifying aspect terms, aspect categories, and sentiment polarities. The dataset is constructed through an automatic translation process with human review to ensure quality. We perform extensive experiments using various baselines to assess performance and compatibility on M-ABSA. Our empirical findings highlight that the dataset enables diverse evaluation tasks, such as multilingual and multi-domain transfer learning, and large language model evaluation, underscoring its inclusivity and its potential to drive advancements in multilingual ABSA research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Fine-Tuning Mechanisms of LLMs via Circuit Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11812v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper aims to provide an in-depth interpretation of the fine-tuning process through circuit analysis, a popular tool in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). Unlike previous studies \cite{prakash2024finetuningenhancesexistingmechanisms,chhabra2024neuroplasticity} that focus on tasks where pre-trained models already perform well, we develop a set of mathematical tasks where fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains, which are closer to the practical setting. In our experiments, we identify circuits at various checkpoints during fine-tuning and examine the interplay between circuit analysis, fine-tuning methods, and task complexities. First, we find that while circuits maintain high node similarity before and after fine-tuning, their edges undergo significant changes, which is in contrast to the previous work \cite{prakash2024finetuningenhancesexistingmechanisms,chhabra2024neuroplasticity} that show circuits only add some additional components after fine-tuning. Based on these observations, we develop a circuit-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, which assigns ranks to layers based on edge changes in the circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our circuit-based LoRA algorithm achieves an average performance improvement of 2.46\% over standard LoRA with similar parameter sizes. Furthermore, we explore how combining circuits from subtasks can enhance fine-tuning in compositional tasks, providing new insights into the design of such tasks and deepening the understanding of circuit dynamics and fine-tuning mechanisms.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FineFilter: A Fine-grained Noise Filtering Mechanism for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11811v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from detecting answer clues, necessitating noise filtering mechanisms to enhance accuracy.Existing methods use re-ranking or summarization to identify the most relevant sentences, but directly and accurately locating answer clues from these large-scale and complex documents remains challenging. Unlike these document-level operations, we treat noise filtering as a sentence-level MinMax optimization problem: first identifying the potential clues from multiple documents using contextual information, then ranking them by relevance, and finally retaining the least clues through truncation. In this paper, we propose FineFilter, a novel fine-grained noise filtering mechanism for RAG consisting of a clue extractor, a re-ranker, and a truncator. We optimize each module to tackle complex reasoning challenges: (1) Clue extractor firstly uses sentences containing the answer and similar ones as fine-tuned targets, aiming at extracting sufficient potential clues; (2) Re-ranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on the real feedback from generation module, with clues capable of generating correct answer as positive samples and others as negative; (3) Truncator takes the minimum clues needed to answer the question (truncation point) as fine-tuned targets, and performs truncation on the re-ranked clues to achieve fine-grained noise filtering. Experiments on three QA datasets demonstrate that FineFilter significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance and inference cost. Further analysis on each module shows the effectiveness of our optimizations for complex reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Translation Mechanism of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11806v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in multilingual translation tasks. However, the inherent translation mechanisms of LLMs remain poorly understood, largely due to sophisticated architectures and vast parameter scales. In response to this issue, this study explores the translation mechanism of LLM from the perspective of computational components (e.g., attention heads and MLPs). Path patching is utilized to explore causal relationships between components, detecting those crucial for translation tasks and subsequently analyzing their behavioral patterns in human-interpretable terms. Comprehensive analysis reveals that translation is predominantly facilitated by a sparse subset of specialized attention heads (less than 5\%), which extract source language, indicator, and positional features. MLPs subsequently integrate and process these features by transiting towards English-centric latent representations. Notably, building on the above findings, targeted fine-tuning of only 64 heads achieves translation improvement comparable to full-parameter tuning while preserving general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization. Code is available at https://github.com/xinghaow99/BitStack.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We refer to them as code-related benchmarks. However, there are no systematic guidelines by which such a benchmark should be developed to ensure its quality, reliability, and reproducibility. We propose How2Bench, which is comprised of a 55-criteria checklist as a set of guidelines to govern the development of code-related benchmarks comprehensively. Using HOW2BENCH, we profiled 274 benchmarks released within the past decade and found concerning issues. Nearly 70% of the benchmarks did not take measures for data quality assurance; over 10% did not even open source or only partially open source. Many highly cited benchmarks have loopholes, including duplicated samples, incorrect reference codes/tests/prompts, and unremoved sensitive/confidential information. Finally, we conducted a human study involving 49 participants, which revealed significant gaps in awareness of the importance of data quality, reproducibility, and transparency.</p></details> | 42 pages |

While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

However, a critical challenge remains in that they sometimes generate factually incorrect answers. To address this, while many previous work has focused on identifying errors in their generation and further refining them, they are slow in deployment since they are designed to verify the response from LLMs only after their entire generation (from the first to last tokens) is done. Further, we observe that once LLMs generate incorrect tokens early on, there is a higher likelihood that subsequent tokens will also be factually incorrect. To this end, in this work, we propose Streaming-VR (Streaming Verification and Refinement), a novel approach designed to enhance the efficiency of verification and refinement of LLM outputs. Specifically, the proposed Streaming-VR enables on-the-fly verification and correction of tokens as they are being generated, similar to a streaming process, ensuring that each subset of tokens is checked and refined in real-time by another LLM as the LLM constructs its response. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the factual accuracy of LLMs, but also offers a more efficient solution compared to prior refinement methods.</p></details> |  |

We provide the first direct analysis by utilizing frozen text representations in a discriminative vision-language model framework and measuring zero-shot generalization on unseen classes. We find decoder-based LLMs exhibit high intrinsic visual alignment. In particular, more capable LLMs reliably demonstrate stronger generalization. Moreover, utilizing frozen LLMs leads to strong gains in cross-lingual settings, where our approach surpasses CLIP's accuracy of 1.4% with 38.7% for Chinese. Our proposed method improves both robustness and generalization and also significantly reduces the need for paired data and compute, making vision-language models more accessible and adaptable.</p></details> |  |

However, a performance gap exists between high- and low-resource language reasoning tasks due to the language imbalance in the pre-training corpus, which is exacerbated by evaluation bias in existing reasoning benchmarks lacking low-resource language coverage. To alleviate this issue, we propose LinguaLIFT, a two-stage instruction tuning framework for advancing low-resource language reasoning. LinguaLIFT employs a language alignment layer to capture multilingual alignment in a code-switched tuning way without requiring multilingual instruction or parallel data, thereby transferring the cross-lingual reasoning capabilities to low-resource languages through English-only instruction tuning data. To comprehensively evaluate the multilingual reasoning capabilities, we introduce the Multilingual Math World Problem (MMWP) benchmark, which spans 21 low-resource, 17 medium-resource, and 10 high-resource languages. Experimental results show that LinguaLIFT outperforms several competitive baselines across MMWP and four widely used benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs while maintaining their target language abilities. DeepSeek R1 excels in reasoning but primarily benefits high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. However, low-resource languages remain underserved due to the dominance of English-centric training data and model optimizations, which limit performance in these languages. This limitation results in unreliable code-switching and diminished effectiveness on tasks in low-resource languages. Meanwhile, local and regional LLM initiatives have attempted to bridge this gap by developing language-specific LLMs that focus on improving local linguistic fidelity. We demonstrate that, with only publicly available datasets and a computational budget of $120, it is possible to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language-specific LLMs to match the level of DeepSeek R1, without compromising their performance on target language tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Efficient Response Generation Method Selection for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11779v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training data for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is typically structured as input-output pairs. However, for many tasks, there can be multiple equally valid output variations for the same input. Recent studies have observed that the choice of output variation used in training can affect the model's performance. This raises an important question: how can we generate the most effective output from the many possible response generation strategy options? Rather than relying on the traditional but resource-intensive train-and-evaluate approach, this paper proposes a scalable, approximate method for estimating the quality of a small subset of generated training data derived from the same input. We then evaluate how well this small subset of generated output fits the target model we are trying to train. We present a large-scale benchmark covering diverse reasoning-based datasets to support our study. The central idea is that a good output should closely resemble the output generated by the target LLM. We formalize this 'closeness' as the expected alignment score between a candidate output and the output sampled from the target LLM. We connect this measurement to the perplexity metric used in previous literature and demonstrate that leveraging an alignment-based metric can provide better predictions of model performance. Using this strategy, we can evaluate a small subset of the generated output from each response generation strategy option, then select the most effective strategy. We show that an LLM trained on data generated by the selected strategy could lead to a significant performance gain in many cases.</p></details> |  |

Hierarchical Layer-Wise and Element-Wise Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13669v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong general language capabilities. However, fine-tuning these models on domain-specific tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model overwrites or loses essential knowledge acquired during pretraining. This phenomenon significantly limits the broader applicability of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compute the element-wise importance of model parameters crucial for preserving general knowledge during fine-tuning. Our method utilizes a dual-objective optimization strategy: (1) regularization loss based on element-wise parameter importance, which constrains the updates to parameters crucial for general knowledge; (2) cross-entropy loss to adapt to domain-specific tasks. Additionally, we introduce layer-wise coefficients to account for the varying contributions of different layers, dynamically balancing the dual-objective optimization. Extensive experiments on scientific, medical, and physical tasks using GPT-J and LLaMA-3 demonstrate that our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing model adaptability. Compared to previous methods, our solution is approximately 20 times faster and requires only 10-15% of the storage, highlighting the practical efficiency. The code will be released.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, LLMs face challenges in visualizing complex, real-world data through charts and plots. Firstly, existing datasets rarely cover a full range of chart types, such as 3D, volumetric, and gridded charts. Secondly, supervised fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage the intricate relationships within rich datasets, including text, code, and figures.

However, current research indicates that LLMs struggle with self-correction, encountering significant challenges in detecting errors. While studies have explored methods to enhance self-correction in LLMs, relatively little attention has been given to understanding the models' internal mechanisms underlying error detection. In this paper, we present a mechanistic analysis of error detection in LLMs, focusing on simple arithmetic problems. Through circuit analysis, we identify the computational subgraphs responsible for detecting arithmetic errors across four smaller-sized LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models heavily rely on $\textit{consistency heads}$--attention heads that assess surface-level alignment of numerical values in arithmetic solutions. Moreover, we observe that the models' internal arithmetic computation primarily occurs in higher layers, whereas validation takes place in middle layers, before the final arithmetic results are fully encoded. This structural dissociation between arithmetic computation and validation seems to explain why current LLMs struggle to detect even simple arithmetic errors.</p></details> | 34 pages, 31 figures |
| **[Cognitive-Aligned Document Selection for Retrieval-augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11770v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) inherently display hallucinations since the precision of generated texts cannot be guaranteed purely by the parametric knowledge they include. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance the accuracy and reliability of generative models by incorporating external documents, these retrieved documents often fail to adequately support the model's responses in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose GGatrieval (Fine-\textbf{G}rained \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{A}lignment Re\textbf{trieval} for verifiable generation), which leverages an LLM to dynamically update queries and filter high-quality, reliable retrieval documents. Specifically, we parse the user query into its syntactic components and perform fine-grained grounded alignment with the retrieved documents. For query components that cannot be individually aligned, we propose a dynamic semantic compensation mechanism that iteratively refines and rewrites the query while continuously updating the retrieval results. This iterative process continues until the retrieved documents sufficiently support the query's response. Our approach introduces a novel criterion for filtering retrieved documents, closely emulating human strategies for acquiring targeted information. This ensures that the retrieved content effectively supports and verifies the generated outputs. On the ALCE benchmark, our method significantly surpasses a wide range of baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2VEval: T2V-generated Videos Benchmark Dataset and Objective Evaluation Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08545v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) technology, as demonstrated by models such as Runway Gen-3, Pika, Sora, and Kling, have significantly broadened the applicability and popularity of the technology. This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, comprising 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text-video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a progressive training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions. This survey aims to serve as an up-to-date resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain an intuitive understanding of LLM-based AL techniques and deploy them to new applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warmup-Distill: Bridge the Distribution Mismatch between Teacher and Student before Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11766v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by the high computational demands, making knowledge distillation (KD) crucial for developing compact smaller ones. However, the conventional KD methods endure the distribution mismatch issue between the teacher and student models, leading to the poor performance of distillation. For instance, the widely-used KL-based methods suffer the mode-averaging and mode-collapsing problems, since the mismatched probabitliy distribution between both models. Previous studies mainly optimize this issue via different distance calculations towards the distribution of both models. Unfortunately, the distribution mismatch issue still exists in the early stage of the distillation. Hence, to reduce the impact of distribution mismatch, we propose a simple yet efficient method, named Warmup-Distill, which aligns the distillation of the student to that of the teacher in advance of distillation. Specifically, we first detect the distribution of the student model in practical scenarios with its internal knowledge, and then modify the knowledge with low probability via the teacher as the checker. Consequently, Warmup-Distill aligns the internal student's knowledge to that of the teacher, which expands the distribution of the student with the teacher's, and assists the student model to learn better in the subsequent distillation. Experiments on the seven benchmarks demonstrate that Warmup-Distill could provide a warmup student more suitable for distillation, which outperforms the vanilla student by as least +0.4 averaged score among all benchmarks. Noteably, with the assistance of Warmup-Distill, the distillation on the math task could yield a further improvement, at most +1.9% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 4 figures, Code at https://github.com/Acerkoo/WarmupDistill</p></details> |
| **[HintsOfTruth: A Multimodal Checkworthiness Detection Dataset with Real and Synthetic Claims](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11753v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Misinformation can be countered with fact-checking, but the process is costly and slow. Identifying checkworthy claims is the first step, where automation can help scale fact-checkers' efforts. However, detection methods struggle with content that is 1) multimodal, 2) from diverse domains, and 3) synthetic. We introduce HintsOfTruth, a public dataset for multimodal checkworthiness detection with $27$K real-world and synthetic image/claim pairs. The mix of real and synthetic data makes this dataset unique and ideal for benchmarking detection methods. We compare fine-tuned and prompted Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that well-configured lightweight text-based encoders perform comparably to multimodal models but the first only focus on identifying non-claim-like content. Multimodal LLMs can be more accurate but come at a significant computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. When faced with synthetic data, multimodal models perform more robustly</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Can See Better: Visual Contrastive Decoding For LLM Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11751v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation for language tasks, they are not specifically designed for multimodal challenges. Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), however, is resource-intensive and constrained by various training limitations. In this paper, we propose the Modular-based Visual Contrastive Decoding (MVCD) framework to move this obstacle. Our framework leverages LLMs' In-Context Learning (ICL) capability and the proposed visual contrastive-example decoding (CED), specifically tailored for this framework, without requiring any additional training. By converting visual signals into text and focusing on contrastive output distributions during decoding, we can highlight the new information introduced by contextual examples, explore their connections, and avoid over-reliance on prior encoded knowledge. MVCD enhances LLMs' visual perception to make it see and reason over the input visuals. To demonstrate MVCD's effectiveness, we conduct experiments with four LLMs across five question answering datasets. Our results not only show consistent improvement in model accuracy but well explain the effective components inside our decoding strategy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Pbhgit/MVCD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Thanks to the application of large language models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in this field. However, challenges such as model scalability, limited generation space, and coherence issues in SQL generation still persist. To address these issues, we propose SQL-o1, a Self-Reward-based heuristic search method designed to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs in SQL query generation. SQL-o1 combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for heuristic process-level search and constructs a Schema-Aware dataset to help the model better understand database schemas. Extensive experiments on the Bird and Spider datasets demonstrate that SQL-o1 improves execution accuracy by 10.8\% on the complex Bird dataset compared to the latest baseline methods, even outperforming GPT-4-based approaches. Additionally, SQL-o1 excels in few-shot learning scenarios and shows strong cross-model transferability. Our code is publicly available at:https://github.com/ShuaiLyu0110/SQL-o1.</p></details> | 10 pages,4 figures |

While large language model (LLMs) offer potential for automating this process, their current limitations include superficial critiques, hallucinations, and a lack of actionable insights. This research addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI-generated reviews, that measures alignment with human evaluations, verifies factual accuracy, assesses analytical depth, and identifies actionable insights. We also propose a novel alignment mechanism that tailors LLM-generated reviews to the unique evaluation priorities of individual conferences and journals. To enhance the quality of these reviews, we introduce a self-refinement loop that iteratively optimizes the LLM's review prompts. Our framework establishes standardized metrics for evaluating AI-based review systems, thereby bolstering the reliability of AI-generated reviews in academic research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review: 8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 3 pages for appendix</p></details> |

Benchmarking Practical Reasoning and Situation Modelling in a Text-Simulated Situated Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11733v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have risen to prominence as 'chatbots' for users to interact via natural language. However, their abilities to capture common-sense knowledge make them seem promising as language-based planners of situated or embodied action as well. We have implemented a simple text-based environment -- similar to others that have before been used for reinforcement-learning of agents -- that simulates, very abstractly, a household setting. We use this environment and the detailed error-tracking capabilities we implemented for targeted benchmarking of LLMs on the problem of practical reasoning: Going from goals and observations to actions. Our findings show that environmental complexity and game restrictions hamper performance, and concise action planning is demanding for current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Catastrophic Forgetting in Cross-Lingual Transfer Paradigms: Exploring Tuning Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06089v3)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cross-lingual transfer is a promising technique to solve tasks in less-resourced languages. In this empirical study, we compare two fine-tuning approaches combined with zero-shot and full-shot learning approaches for large language models in a cross-lingual setting. As fine-tuning strategies, we compare parameter-efficient adapter methods with fine-tuning of all parameters. As cross-lingual transfer strategies, we compare the intermediate-training (\textit{IT}) that uses each language sequentially and cross-lingual validation (\textit{CLV}) that uses a target language already in the validation phase of fine-tuning. We assess the success of transfer and the extent of catastrophic forgetting in a source language due to cross-lingual transfer, i.e., how much previously acquired knowledge is lost when we learn new information in a different language. The results on two different classification problems, hate speech detection and product reviews, each containing datasets in several languages, show that the \textit{IT} cross-lingual strategy outperforms \textit{CLV} for the target language. Our findings indicate that, in the majority of cases, the \textit{CLV} strategy demonstrates superior retention of knowledge in the base language (English) compared to the \textit{IT} strategy, when evaluating catastrophic forgetting in multiple cross-lingual transfers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Energy-Conscious LLM Decoding: Impact of Text Generation Strategies on GPU Energy Consumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11723v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding strategies significantly influence the quality and diversity of the generated texts in large language models (LLMs), yet their impact on computational resource consumption, particularly GPU energy usage, is insufficiently studied. This paper investigates the relationship between text generation decoding methods and energy efficiency, focusing on the trade-off between generation quality and GPU energy consumption across diverse tasks and decoding configurations. By benchmarking multiple strategies across different text generation tasks, such as Translation, Code Summarization, and Math Problem Solving, we reveal how selecting appropriate decoding techniques with their tuned hyperparameters affects text quality and has measurable implications for resource utilization, emphasizing the need for balanced optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to explore decoding strategies in LLMs through the lens of energy consumption, offering actionable insights for designing resource-aware applications that maintain high-quality text generation.</p></details> |  |
